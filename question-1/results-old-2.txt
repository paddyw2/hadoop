     Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,	
	
     Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more	
	
     Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about	
	
     Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,	
	
     Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,	
	
     Election makes not up on such conditions.	
	
     Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less	
	
     Exit.	
	
     Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,	
	
     For I am almost ready to dissolve,	
	
     For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,	
	
     For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.	
	
     From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en	
	
     Give me the map there. Know we have divided	
	
     Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect	
	
     Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better.

     He but usurp'd his life.	
	
     He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out	
	
     He'll shape his old course in a country new.	
	
     Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel	
	
     His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life	
	
     His word was still	
	
     How have you known the miseries of your father?	
	
     How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is	
	
     I am sure of that; and at her late being here	
	
     I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from me	
	
     I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd	
	
     I hold you but a subject of this war,	
	
     I must change arms at home and give the distaff	
	
     I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,	
	
     I will say nothing.	
	
     I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,	
	
     I'll do't before I speak- that you make known	
	
     If for I want that glib and oily art	
	
     If none appear to prove upon thy person	
	
     If you have poison for me, I will drink it.	
	
     In his own course.	
	
     In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!	
	
     Inform her full of my particular fear,	
	
     Into this scattered kingdom, who already,	
	
     Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit	
	
     It pleas'd the King his master very late	
	
     It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,	
	
     Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.	
	
     Let her who would be rid of him devise	
	
     Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook	
	
     Life would not yield to age.	
	
     Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,	
	
     Make servants of their betters.	
	
     May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.	
	
     Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st	
	
     More sinn'd against than sinning.	
	
     My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.        [Exeunt.]	
	
     My fool usurps my body.	
	
     My masters, know you that?	
	
     My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;	
	
     No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;	
	
     None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.	
	
     Not as a brother.	
	
     Now, fellow, fare thee well.	
	
     Of differences, which I best thought it fit	
	
     Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you	
	
     Of this remove.	
	
     One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost	
	
     Or cease your quest of love?	
	
     Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.	
	
     Owes nothing to thy blasts.	
	
     Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart	
	
     Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to	
	
     Reason, in madness!	
	
     Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house	
	
     Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,	
	
     Shall never see his pardon; for my state	
	
     She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks	
	
     She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.	
	
     Since that respects of fortune are his love,	
	
     So many folds of favour. Sure her offence	
	
     So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.	
	
     Spare speech.	
	
     Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!	
	
     Stands on the hourly thought.	
	
     Strike!                                        [Beats him.]	
	
     T' obey in all your daughters' hard commands.	
	
     Ten masts at each make not the altitude	
	
     Than she to scant her duty.	
	
     That all particulars of duty know	
	
     That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs	
	
     That guard and most unusual vigilance	
	
     That made the overture of thy treasons to us;	
	
     That she fordid herself.	
	
     That slaves your ordinance, that will not see	
	
     That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,	
	
     That we present us to him.	
	
     That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.             Exit.

     Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!	
	
     There's mine! beg another of thy daughters.	
	
     They are apt enough to dislocate and tear	
	
     This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim, fair	
	
     This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,	
	
     Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!	
	
     Thou losest here, a better where to find.	
	
     Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.'	
	
     Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.	
	
     Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,	
	
     Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!	
	
     To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!	
	
     To deal with grief alone.	
	
     To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.	
	
     To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg	
	
     To make thee capable.	
	
     To pluck the common bosom on his side	
	
     To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,	
	
     To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King,	
	
     To understand my purposes aright.	
	
     To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,	
	
     Truly, however else.

    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.	
	
    Among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue	
	
    An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,	
	
    An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.	
	
    An ancient angel coming down the hill	
	
    An arm as big as thine, a heart as big?	
	
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life	
	
    An honour in him which buys out his fault-	
	
    An hour by his dial. O noble fool!	
	
    An if my face were but as fair as yours,	
	
    An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view	
	
    An she agree, within her scope of choice	
	
    An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.	
	
    And 'tis my hope to end successfully.	
	
    And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.	
	
    And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir.	
	
    And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,	
	
    And Florence is denied before he comes;	
	
    And God forgive them that so much have sway'd	
	
    And Henry born at Windsor should lose all.	
	
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.	
	
    And I am tied to be obedient-	
	
    And I challenge law-attorneys are denied me;	
	
    And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.	
	
    And I do stand engag'd to many Greeks,	
	
    And I have better news in store for you	
	
    And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,	
	
    And I must find that title in your tongue	
	
    And I shall show you peace and fair-fac'd league;	
	
    And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,	
	
    And I will be revenged on them all.	
	
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.	
	
    And I will put that business in your bosoms	
	
    And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,	
	
    And I'll be bid by thee.	
	
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.	
	
    And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power;	
	
    And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.        [DERBY rises]	
	
    And In the morning early shall mine uncle	
	
    And Portia one, there must be something else	
	
    And Sir John Stanley is appointed now	
	
    And Troiant Greeks? Nay, rather damn them with	
	
    And a clear life ensuing.	
	
    And add more coals to Cancer when he burns	
	
    And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make	
	
    And all great fears, which now import their dangers,	
	
    And all my followers to the eager foe	
	
    And all out of an empty coffer;	
	
    And all the better is it for the maid.	
	
    And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!	
	
    And all the men and women merely players;	
	
    And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,	
	
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.	
	
    And all to have the noble Duke alive.	
	
    And all unlook'd for from your Highness' mouth.	
	
    And am so near the lack of charity	
	
    And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.	
	
    And apprehended here immediately	
	
    And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore	
	
    And as imagination bodies forth	
	
    And as the long divorce of steel falls on me	
	
    And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,	
	
    And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,	
	
    And at the dean'ry, where a priest attends,	
	
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like	
	
    And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.	
	
    And be in debt to none- yet, more to move you,	
	
    And be my heart an ever-burning hell!	
	
    And be received for the Emperor's heir	
	
    And bear it from me to the Emperess.	
	
    And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.	
	
    And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.	
	
    And better in my mind not undertook.	
	
    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-	
	
    And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,	
	
    And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,	
	
    And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,	
	
    And bless it to all fair prosperity.	
	
    And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,	
	
    And blown with restless violence round about	
	
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.	
	
    And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,	
	
    And break my utt'rance, even in the time	
	
    And bring all Cyprus comfort.	
	
    And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate	
	
    And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,	
	
    And brought with armed men back to Messina.	
	
    And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;	
	
    And buy it with your gold right suddenly.             Exeunt	
	
    And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy'd her.	
	
    And by his side his fruit of bastardy.	
	
    And by that destiny, to perform an act	
	
    And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,	
	
    And by their vehement instigation,	
	
    And by-and-by my master drew on him;	
	
    And call these foul offenders to their answers,	
	
    And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.	
	
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,	
	
    And celebrate our drink?	
	
    And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand;	
	
    And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.	
	
    And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;	
	
    And come against us in full puissance	
	
    And come, young Cato; let us to the field.	
	
    And constant do remain to keep him so.	
	
    And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.	
	
    And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.	
	
    And crowns for convoy put into his purse;	
	
    And curbs himself even of his natural scope	
	
    And dallies with the innocence of love,	
	
    And dare me to the desert with thy sword.	
	
    And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,	
	
    And deck my body in gay ornaments,	
	
    And did entreat your Highness to this course	
	
    And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's!	
	
    And do as I have bid you.	
	
    And do not play in wench-like words with that	
	
    And do you now cull out a holiday?	
	
    And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,	
	
    And down goes all before them. Still be kind,	
	
    And drink it off, and if you had the strength	
	
    And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.	
	
    And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.	
	
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out	
	
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,	
	
    And ere that we will suffer such a prince,	
	
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,	
	
    And even with this I lost fair England's view,	
	
    And every hour more competitors	
	
    And everything that seems unnatural.	
	
    And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die.	
	
    And falls on the other.	
	
    And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,	
	
    And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?	
	
    And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent.	
	
    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full	
	
    And finds the testy gentleman so hot	
	
    And fitter is my study and my books	
	
    And flashing fire will follow.	
	
    And follow to thine answer.	
	
    And food for-                                        [Dies.]	
	
    And for amends to his posterity,	
	
    And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple	
	
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well	
	
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,	
	
    And for thy sake have I shed many a tear.	
	
    And foreign mart for implements of war;	
	
    And found no course of breath within your Majesty,	
	
    And free from other misbegotten hate,	
	
    And from his bosom purge this black despair!	
	
    And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him;	
	
    And from thy hated presence part I so;	
	
    And gallop o'er the field.	
	
    And gave his countenance, against his name,	
	
    And get you from our court.	
	
    And give assurance to Baptista Minola	
	
    And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.	
	
    And give to dust that is a little gilt	
	
    And give us notice of his inclination;	
	
    And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle;	
	
    And golden Phoebus never be beheld	
	
    And good from bad find no partition.	
	
    And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom	
	
    And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.	
	
    And guardian of their bones.	
	
    And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.	
	
    And happily may your sweet self put on	
	
    And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!	
	
    And haste is needful in this desp'rate case.	
	
    And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments	
	
    And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer	
	
    And have their provender tied to their mouths,	
	
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties	
	
    And he her dieter.	
	
    And he our subjects' next degree in hope.	
	
    And he shall signify from time to time	
	
    And he that breaks them in the least degree	
	
    And he to England shall along with you.	
	
    And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo	
	
    And he, long traded in it, makes it seem	
	
    And heartily entreats you take good comfort.	
	
    And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,	
	
    And help to set a head on headless Rome.	
	
    And her quietus is to render thee.	
	
    And here at hand the Dauphin and his train	
	
    And here my naked breast; within, a heart	
	
    And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when	
	
    And here, I take it, is the doctor come.	
	
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-	
	
    And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside	
	
    And his enforcement of the city wives;	
	
    And his physicians fear him mightily.	
	
    And his unkindness may defeat my life,	
	
    And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.	
	
    And how desirous of our sight they are.	
	
    And how you find her.	
	
    And humbly now upon my bended knee,	
	
    And if King Edward be as true and just	
	
    And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.	
	
    And if their wisdoms be misled in this,	
	
    And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread	
	
    And if we thrive, promise them such rewards	
	
    And in conclusion drove us to seek out	
	
    And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart	
	
    And in his simple show he harbours treason.	
	
    And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd,	
	
    And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;	
	
    And in that quarrel use it to the death.	
	
    And in the cup an union shall he throw	
	
    And in the power of us the tribunes, we,	
	
    And in the very pangs of death he cried,	
	
    And in their ears tell them my dreadful name-	
	
    And in this shape. When you have brought him thither,	
	
    And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy;	
	
    And is enough for both.	
	
    And is not this an honourable spoil?	
	
    And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets	
	
    And it shall please me well. For mine own part,	
	
    And keep no tell-tale to his memory	
	
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,	
	
    And kill him in the shell.	
	
    And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,	
	
    And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;	
	
    And laid his love and life under my foot;	
	
    And last so long enough!	
	
    And lawful meaning in a lawful act;	
	
    And lay them gently on thy tender side.	
	
    And leave his master Antony. For this pains	
	
    And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t?	
	
    And leave those woes alone which I alone	
	
    And left behind him Richard, his only son,	
	
    And let confusion live. Plagues incident to men,	
	
    And let him say to England that we send	
	
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,	
	
    And let me find a charter in your voice	
	
    And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.          Exit	
	
    And let our army be discharged too.	
	
    And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas	
	
    And let this world no longer be a stage	
	
    And let us once again assail your ears,	
	
    And liberty plucks justice by the nose;	
	
    And lie full low, grav'd in the hollow ground.	
	
    And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts	
	
    And liquor likewise will I give to thee,	
	
    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,	
	
    And live we how we can, yet die we must.	
	
    And look on their endeavour.                          Exeunt	
	
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!	
	
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,	
	
    And made him to resign his crown perforce.	
	
    And made no deeper wounds? O flatt'ring glass,	
	
    And majesty might never yet endure	
	
    And make a monster of you.	
	
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine	
	
    And make her chronicle as rich with praise	
	
    And make his wrongs his outsides,	
	
    And make some pretty match with shedding tears?	
	
    And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.	
	
    And make this marriage to be solemniz'd.	
	
    And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.	
	
    And makes men mad.	
	
    And many an old man's sigh, and many a widow's,	
	
    And many limits of the charge set down	
	
    And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,	
	
    And may not be performed by thyself,	
	
    And meet me presently at Berkeley.	
	
    And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.	
	
    And mere instinct of love and loyalty,	
	
    And mock for mock is only my intent.	
	
    And module of confounded royalty.	
	
    And more than carefully it us concerns	
	
    And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear.	
	
    And mountainous error be too highly heap'd	
	
    And my appointments have in them a need	
	
    And my large kingdom for a little grave,	
	
    And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,	
	
    And neither way inclines.	
	
    And never brandish more revengeful steel	
	
    And never mayst thou come Lysander near!	
	
    And never suffers matter of the world	
	
    And never, since the middle summer's spring,	
	
    And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.	
	
    And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead	
	
    And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.	
	
    And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,	
	
    And not believes himself. Down with the nose,	
	
    And not have tide of an earldom here.	
	
    And not our streets with war!	
	
    And not provok'd by any suitor else-	
	
    And not to spend it so unneighbourly!	
	
    And nothing of a man.	
	
    And now 'tis up again. It must be married	
	
    And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,	
	
    And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords.	
	
    And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,	
	
    And now their pride and mettle is asleep,	
	
    And now what rests but, in night's coverture,	
	
    And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.	
	
    And of his old experience th' only darling,	
	
    And of opposed natures.	
	
    And on all sides th' authority allow'd;	
	
    And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,	
	
    And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls,	
	
    And on your finger in the night I'll put	
	
    And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.	
	
    And open perils surest answered.	
	
    And our dull workings. O, who shall believe	
	
    And our nobility will scorn the match.	
	
    And overlooks the highest-peering hills,	
	
    And pardon on lily true submission.	
	
    And passion, having my best judgement collied,	
	
    And pav'd with gold, the Emperor thus desir'd,	
	
    And pierce the inmost centre of the earth;	
	
    And pity to the general wrong of Rome-	
	
    And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.	
	
    And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:	
	
    And pour'd them down before him.	
	
    And pray thee take this mercy to provide	
	
    And present execution of our wills	
	
    And prodigally gave them all to you.	
	
    And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth	
	
    And prove it too against mine honour, aught,	
	
    And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder	
	
    And quaff carouses to our mistress' health;	
	
    And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge	
	
    And rack thee in their fancies.	
	
    And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle-	
	
    And raught not to five weeks when he came to five-score.	
	
    And reason flies the object of all harm.	
	
    And revel in Lavinia's treasury.	
	
    And rotten times that you shall look upon	
	
    And salt too little which may season give	
	
    And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes	
	
    And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,	
	
    And say I spoke with you.	
	
    And say withal I think he held the right.	
	
    And says a wizard told him that by G	
	
    And scout 'em and flout 'em;	
	
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.	
	
    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.	
	
    And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?	
	
    And send for money for 'em.	
	
    And send them after to supply our wants;	
	
    And sent to warn them to his royal presence.	
	
    And set the triple crown upon his head;	
	
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows	
	
    And shall forget the office of our hand	
	
    And shape his service wholly to my hests,	
	
    And she as much in love, her means much less	
	
    And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,	
	
    And she shall file our engines with advice	
	
    And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye	
	
    And show me to the shouting varletry	
	
    And show'd thou mak'st some tender of my life,	
	
    And shows the ragged entrails of this pit;	
	
    And since this business so fair is done,	
	
    And since you could not be my son-in-law,	
	
    And sit thee by our side. [Seats her by him] Yield not thy neck	
	
    And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,	
	
    And smote him, thus.                               Stabs himself.	
	
    And so I am awake. Poor wretches, that depend	
	
    And so I take my leave, and thank you both.	
	
    And so am I for Phebe.	
	
    And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.	
	
    And so farewell. I would not have my father	
	
    And so it shall be so for Katherine.	
	
    And so may I, blind Fortune leading me,	
	
    And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start	
	
    And so success of mischief shall be born,	
	
    And so, espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd	
	
    And so, most joyfully, we take our leave.	
	
    And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,	
	
    And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.	
	
    And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty;	
	
    And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,	
	
    And speaks not to himself but with a pride	
	
    And spleen of speed to see your Majesty!	
	
    And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds	
	
    And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,	
	
    And started when he look'd upon the Tower,	
	
    And still to nose th' offence.	
	
    And stole into the covert of the wood.	
	
    And strain what other means is left unto us	
	
    And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,	
	
    And substituted in the place of mine,	
	
    And sudden push gives them the overthrow.	
	
    And sullen presage of your own decay.	
	
    And swear with me- as, with the woeful fere	
	
    And sweet revenge grows harsh.	
	
    And take his bottle from him. When that's gone	
	
    And take with you free power to ratify,	
	
    And takes away the stomach- such are the rich	
	
    And tame the savage spirit of wild war,	
	
    And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise	
	
    And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale	
	
    And tell thy king I do not seek him now,	
	
    And ten to one is no impeach of valour.	
	
    And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;	
	
    And that I would not for a cow, God save her!	
	
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him	
	
    And that is to enjoy thee for my love.	
	
    And that my fortune runs against the bias.	
	
    And that same dew which sometime on the buds	
	
    And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince,	
	
    And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.	
	
    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath	
	
    And that we find the slothful watch but weak,	
	
    And that within ourselves we disagree,	
	
    And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.	
	
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,	
	
    And the conjunction of our inward souls	
	
    And the division of our amity.	
	
    And the imperial vot'ress passed on,	
	
    And the persuasion of his augurers	
	
    And the rank poison of the old will die.	
	
    And their executors, the knavish crows,	
	
    And then I came away.	
	
    And then a mind put in't, either our brags	
	
    And then down falls again.	
	
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,	
	
    And then it was when the unhappy King	
	
    And then the power of Scotland and of York	
	
    And then to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.	
	
    And then you would have tarried. Hark! there's one up.	
	
    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;	
	
    And there an end; but now they rise again,	
	
    And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,	
	
    And there we will abide. I do desire you	
	
    And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.	
	
    And therefore comes my brother Montague.	
	
    And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith	
	
    And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.	
	
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd	
	
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg	
	
    And therein show'd fike enemies.	
	
    And these assume but valour's excrement	
	
    And these he masters now. Now he weighs time	
	
    And they did make no noise- in such a night,	
	
    And they shall be themselves.	
	
    And they shall live, and he in them still green.	
	
    And think how such an apprehension	
	
    And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,	
	
    And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,	
	
    And this is he was his adopted heir.	
	
    And this soft courage makes your followers faint.	
	
    And this, so sole and so unmatchable,	
	
    And those musicians that shall play to you	
	
    And thou art flying to a fresher clime.	
	
    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.	
	
    And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?	
	
    And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.	
	
    And thou with all pleas'd, that hast an achiev'd.	
	
    And thou-	
	
    And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,	
	
    And thrice again, to make up nine.	
	
    And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'	
	
    And thrust thyself into their companies.	
	
    And thus she is deliver'd.	
	
    And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending	
	
    And till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman.	
	
    And time, that takes survey of all the world,	
	
    And to conclude, reproach and beggary	
	
    And to myself become an enemy.	
	
    And to rebuke the usurpation	
	
    And to that vineyard is a planched gate	
	
    And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,	
	
    And to thee and thy company I bid	
	
    And took his voice who should be prick'd to die	
	
    And toward the education of your daughters	
	
    And tricking for our fairies.	
	
    And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.	
	
    And turn him to no pain; but if he start,	
	
    And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,	
	
    And two Northumberlands- two braver men	
	
    And underwrite in an observing kind	
	
    And use thou all th' endeavour of a man	
	
    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.	
	
    And vows to crown himself in Westminster.	
	
    And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,	
	
    And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.	
	
    And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,	
	
    And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;	
	
    And we of thee; so, if the time thrust forth	
	
    And we shall have more wars befor't be long.	
	
    And we will make thee famous through the world.	
	
    And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,	
	
    And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!	
	
    And well am like to do, for I perceive	
	
    And what God will, that let your King perform;	
	
    And what he will, I humbly yield unto.                Exeunt	
	
    And what is left, to lose it by his country	
	
    And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?	
	
    And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;	
	
    And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.	
	
    And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.'	
	
    And when I told thee he was of my counsel	
	
    And when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature	
	
    And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,	
	
    And when the dusky sky began to rob	
	
    And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,	
	
    And when you are desirous to be blest,	
	
    And when you would say something that is sad,	
	
    And where we are our learning likewise is;	
	
    And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,	
	
    And whiter than the paper it writ on	
	
    And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?	
	
    And will as tenderly be led by the nose	
	
    And will not any way dishonour me.	
	
    And will not trust one of her malice with	
	
    And will to save the blood on either side,	
	
    And will you rent our ancient love asunder,	
	
    And wish for all that, that I had not kill'd them.	
	
    And wish'd in silence that it were not his.	
	
    And with a look so piteous in purport	
	
    And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice!	
	
    And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France	
	
    And with his spirits sadly I survive,	
	
    And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.	
	
    And with submissive loyalty of heart	
	
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken	
	
    And with the half-blown rose; but Fortune, O!	
	
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd	
	
    And with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd	
	
    And witness of the malice and displeasure	
	
    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'	
	
    And worthy shameful check it were, to stand	
	
    And would have kept so long as breath did last.	
	
    And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter	
	
    And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,	
	
    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,	
	
    And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,	
	
    And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?	
	
    And yet it is not that I bear thee love;	
	
    And yet no matter- why should we go in?	
	
    And yet salt water blinds them not so much	
	
    And yet the spacious breadth of this division	
	
    And yet we hear no tidings from the King;	
	
    And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come	
	
    And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you,	
	
    And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,	
	
    And you have slander'd nature in my form,	
	
    And you shall understand from me her mind.	
	
    And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.	
	
    And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,	
	
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,	
	
    And your great flow of debts. My lov'd lord,	
	
    And yours, the noble sinews of our power,	
	
    And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see	
	
    And, after some dispatch in hand at court,	
	
    And, among three, to love the worst of all,	
	
    And, as the jest did glance away from me,	
	
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,	
	
    And, being troubled with a raging tooth,	
	
    And, by the near guess of my memory,	
	
    And, commendable prov'd, let's die in pride.          Exeunt	
	
    And, fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,	
	
    And, for my name of George begins with G,	
	
    And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:	
	
    And, his corruption being taken from us,	
	
    And, in advantage ling'ring, looks for rescue,	
	
    And, in his full and ripened years, himself,	
	
    And, in the fortune of my lord your son,	
	
    And, like a man to double business bound,	
	
    And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,	
	
    And, look when I am King, claim thou of me	
	
    And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath	
	
    And, on a safer judgment, all revoke	
	
    And, sir, it is no little thing to make	
	
    And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd	
	
    And, to be noted for a merry man,	
	
    And, were these inward wars once out of hand,	
	
    And, when your honours mean to solemnize	
	
    And, with a feeble grip, says 'Dear my lord,	
	
    And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium	
	
    Angelo? They have confess'd you did.	
	
    Anon do meet the Senate.	
	
    Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,	
	
    Another tell him of his hounds and horse,	
	
    Answer'd my steps too loud.	
	
    Antonio, gratify this gentleman,	
	
    Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian; help, Iras, help;	
	
    Any hard lesson that may do thee good.	
	
    Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;	
	
    Approach, my Ariel. Come.	
	
    Are all the people mad?	
	
    Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,	
	
    Are brought to the correction of your law.	
	
    Are come to have some conference with his Grace.	
	
    Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.	
	
    Are hated most of those they did deceive,	
	
    Are levying powers; we must straight make head;	
	
    Are melted into air, into thin air;	
	
    Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,	
	
    Are near at hand. The rest the paper tells. [Gives a letter]	
	
    Are not you he?	
	
    Are of two houses: lawful mercy	
	
    Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.	
	
    Are sometimes, like our judgments, blind. Good faith,	
	
    Are these the breed of wits so wondered at?	
	
    Are to your throne and state, children and servants,	
	
    Are we not brothers?	
	
    Are you fast married? Be assured of this,	
	
    Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him;	
	
    Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!	
	
    Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!	
	
    Arrest them to the answer of the law;	
	
    Art thou damn'd, Hubert.	
	
    Art thou of blood and honour?	
	
    Arthur ta'en prisoner? Divers dear friends slain?	
	
    As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortune,	
	
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.	
	
    As Henry's late presaging prophecy	
	
    As I am confident and kind to thee.	
	
    As I can change these poor accoutrements,	
	
    As I do pray the gods.	
	
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.	
	
    As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!	
	
    As I intended, for it wrought on her	
	
    As I will lend you cause, my doing well	
	
    As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!	
	
    As Lewis himself. So, nobles, shall you all,	
	
    As a sick girl. Ye gods! It doth amaze me	
	
    As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,	
	
    As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.	
	
    As are companions noted and most known	
	
    As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.	
	
    As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.	
	
    As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth	
	
    As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;	
	
    As confident as is the falcon's flight	
	
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.	
	
    As does a Britain peasant. So I'll fight	
	
    As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,	
	
    As e'er I heard in madness.	
	
    As ere thy father Henry made it mine;	
	
    As far as doth the Capitol exceed	
	
    As fearfully as doth a galled rock	
	
    As fits a king's remembrance.	
	
    As for my country I have shed my blood,	
	
    As for your spiteful false objections,	
	
    As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.	
	
    As gentle tell me of what honour was	
	
    As great'st does least.	
	
    As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb	
	
    As he in his particular act and place	
	
    As he is striking, holds his infant up,	
	
    As he's reported by this gentleman;	
	
    As here at home, suggests the King our master	
	
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid	
	
    As hotly and as nobly with thy love	
	
    As if I did but only chew his name,	
	
    As if he did contemn what he requested	
	
    As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,	
	
    As if the world were all dissolv'd to tears,	
	
    As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?	
	
    As in a soul rememb'ring my good friends;	
	
    As in the prizer. 'Tis mad idolatry	
	
    As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.	
	
    As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it	
	
    As it is known she is-these moral laws	
	
    As it is like him, might break out and swear	
	
    As kill a man, or else devise his death;	
	
    As likely to be blest in peace and war;	
	
    As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.	
	
    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.	
	
    As many other mannish cowards have	
	
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;	
	
    As might hold sortance with his quality,	
	
    As morning roses newly wash'd with dew.	
	
    As much as me my dukedom.	
	
    As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band	
	
    As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!	
	
    As often as I guess'd.	
	
    As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd	
	
    As one unworthy all the former favours	
	
    As ours by murder, to make him a king!	
	
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.	
	
    As puts me from my faith. I tell you what-	
	
    As rushing out of doors, to be resolved	
	
    As shall with either part's agreement stand?	
	
    As shore of rock. Attend: this holy fox,	
	
    As soul and body's severing.	
	
    As that is desperate which we would prevent.	
	
    As that whereof I had the government,	
	
    As the ripe revenue and due of birth,	
	
    As the unsullied lily, I protest,	
	
    As therein are set down.	
	
    As they smelt music; so I charm'd their cars,	
	
    As this their jangling I esteem a sport.	
	
    As those which sell would give; but you well know	
	
    As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;	
	
    As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.	
	
    As thus for thus, and such a grief for such,	
	
    As to annoy us all, which to prevent,	
	
    As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow	
	
    As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire	
	
    As too triumphing, how mine enemies	
	
    As very infants prattle of thy pride.	
	
    As we are now glad to behold your eyes-	
	
    As we this garden! We at time of year	
	
    As we will ours; and here, between the armies,	
	
    As well of glib and slipp'ry creatures as	
	
    As well to see the vessel that's come in	
	
    As when, by night and negligence, the fire	
	
    As who goes farthest.	
	
    As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,	
	
    As words to little purpose.	
	
    As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.	
	
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,	
	
    As you malign our senators for that	
	
    As you threw caps up will he tumble down,	
	
    As yours was put into you, ever casts	
	
    As, deathsmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!	
	
    As, sick and blunted with community,	
	
    Ascribes the glory of his conquest got	
	
    Assist, good friends.	
	
    At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,	
	
    At Priam's royal table do I sit;	
	
    At a poor man's house; he us'd me kindly.	
	
    At every joint and motive of her body.	
	
    At her life's rate.	
	
    At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye	
	
    At length they came to th' broomstaff to me; I defied 'em	
	
    At our great bidding?	
	
    At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?	
	
    At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber.	
	
    At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,	
	
    At your employment, at your service, sir!'	
	
    Attend the true event, and put we on	
	
    Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,	
	
    Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy,	
	
    Authority so weighty.	
	
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,	
	
    Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.	
	
    Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!	
	
    Away, I say; commend me to thy master.           Exit TAILOR	
	
    Away, and for our flight.	
	
    Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death	
	
    Ay, and forswore himself-which Jesu pardon!-	
	
    Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear	
	
    Ay, now begins our sorrows to approach.	
	
    BOTH. We'll take your offer kindly.                   Exeunt	
	
    Bade me rely on him as on my father,	
	
    Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,	
	
    Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have	
	
    Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have Claudio's	
	
    Bassanio presently will go aboard;	
	
    Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,	
	
    Be blind with tears and break o'ercharg'd with grief.	
	
    Be buckled with. The over daring Talbot	
	
    Be candidatus then, and put it on,	
	
    Be curses to yourselves? You should have said	
	
    Be factious for redress of all these griefs,	
	
    Be full expir'd. Thanks, uncle Winchester,	
	
    Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors.	
	
    Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.	
	
    Be it so she will not here before your Grace	
	
    Be living and be here?	
	
    Be near me, that I may remember you.	
	
    Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.	
	
    Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;	
	
    Be now produc'd and heard.	
	
    Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended.	
	
    Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,	
	
    Be shook to airy air.	
	
    Be soon collected, and all things thought upon	
	
    Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools	
	
    Be there in person?	
	
    Be thou my witness that, against my will,	
	
    Be unto us as is a nurse's song	
	
    Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em;	
	
    Be you rememb'red, Marcus; she's gone, she's fled.	
	
    Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them.	
	
    Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.	
	
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.	
	
    Bears all down with her brain; and this her son	
	
    Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrake.	
	
    Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.	
	
    Because I cannot flatter and look fair,	
	
    Because all those things you have done of late,	
	
    Because in quarrel of the house of York	
	
    Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste.	
	
    Because that she as her attendant hath	
	
    Because you are not of our quality,	
	
    Because you want the grace that others have,	
	
    Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd. Therefore	
	
    Becomes thee well enough.	
	
    Bedford, if thou be slack I'll fight it out.	
	
    Before I have a husband for the elder.	
	
    Before I see thee seated in that throne	
	
    Before a friend of this description	
	
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;	
	
    Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd	
	
    Before the expiration of thy time,	
	
    Before the time I did Lysander see,	
	
    Before thou make a trial of her love?	
	
    Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,	
	
    Before you serve.	
	
    Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,	
	
    Begins his golden progress in the East.	
	
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself	
	
    Behold the ordnance on their carriages,	
	
    Behold this maid. All corners else o' th' earth	
	
    Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect	
	
    Being but the one half of an entire sum	
	
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd	
	
    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!	
	
    Being ne'er so little urg'd, another way	
	
    Being pent from liberty as I am now,	
	
    Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.	
	
    Being the bosom lover of my lord,	
	
    Being, as it is, much spoke of.	
	
    Believe not thy disdain, but presently	
	
    Believe't that we'll do anything for gold.	
	
    Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!	
	
    Beseeching God and you to pardon me.	
	
    Beside that of the Jewel House, is made Master	
	
    Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,	
	
    Besides, his expedition promises	
	
    Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy	
	
    Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple	
	
    Betimes i' th' morn I'll call you at your house;	
	
    Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th' army.	
	
    Between my father and my mother lay,	
	
    Between our statures; she hath urg'd her height;	
	
    Between the pass and fell incensed points	
	
    Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,	
	
    Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;	
	
    Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.	
	
    Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,	
	
    Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.	
	
    Bid our commanders lead their charges off	
	
    Bid'st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish;	
	
    Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host,	
	
    Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm	
	
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.	
	
    Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.	
	
    Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,	
	
    Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.	
	
    Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt	
	
    Both as the same, or rather ours the elder-	
	
    Both him and all his brothers unto reason.	
	
    Both of his truth and him-which was too far-	
	
    Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech	
	
    Both what by sea and land I can be able	
	
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,	
	
    Boys.	
	
    Brake off our business for the Holy Land.	
	
    Break open shops; nothing can you steal	
	
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,	
	
    Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,	
	
    Bring her to try wi' th' maincourse.  [A cry within]  A	
	
    Bring him our purposes; and so farewell.	
	
    Bring up your army; but I think you'll find	
	
    Brings in the champion Honour on my part	
	
    Brook; Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.            Exit	
	
    Brought my too diligent ear; for several virtues	
	
    Brought to this shore; and by my prescience	
	
    Buck, buck, buck! ay, buck! I warrant you, buck; and of	
	
    Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold;	
	
    Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,	
	
    But 'tis not so.	
	
    But Exeter hath given the doom of death	
	
    But I am doubtful of your modesties,	
	
    But I am troubled here with them myself;	
	
    But I can tell you that of late this Duke	
	
    But I had rather kill two enemies.	
	
    But I protest I love to hear him lie,	
	
    But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks	
	
    But I will find him when he lies asleep,	
	
    But I will wed thee in another key,	
	
    But I'll not trust thee.	
	
    But Pandarus-O gods, how do you plague me!	
	
    But Romeo may not. More validity,	
	
    But all are banish'd till their conversations	
	
    But all the honour Salisbury hath won	
	
    But as successively, from blood to blood,	
	
    But be he as he will, yet once ere night	
	
    But be of comfort.	
	
    But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.	
	
    But by example- O, a sin in war	
	
    But by some power it is- my love to Hermia,	
	
    But by thy help to this distressed queen?	
	
    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger	
	
    But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device	
	
    But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd.	
	
    But direct villainy. Therefore be abhorr'd	
	
    But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.	
	
    But either it was different in blood-	
	
    But even with law against the wilful sons	
	
    But falls into abatement and low price	
	
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.	
	
    But first I will release the Fairy Queen.	
	
    But fly you must; uncurable discomfit	
	
    But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,	
	
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:	
	
    But from Lord Angelo by special charge.	
	
    But get thee back, my soul is too much charged	
	
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw	
	
    But had his titles by Tenantius, whom	
	
    But he that hath the steerage of my course	
	
    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,	
	
    But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.	
	
    But here they live to end.	
	
    But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.	
	
    But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,	
	
    But if I tell how these two did coact,	
	
    But if it did infect my blood with joy,	
	
    But if without him we be thought too feeble,	
	
    But if your title to the crown be weak,	
	
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,	
	
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd	
	
    But in the less foul profanation.	
	
    But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.	
	
    But jealous for they are jealous. 'Tis a monster	
	
    But kill not all together.	
	
    But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,	
	
    But let concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,	
	
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;	
	
    But let our plot go forward. Let our wives	
	
    But let's about it.                                   Exeunt	
	
    But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?	
	
    But little thinks we shall be of her council.	
	
    But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.	
	
    But may imagine how the bird was dead,	
	
    But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,	
	
    But mine is made the prologue to their play;	
	
    But more when envy breeds unkind division:	
	
    But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets	
	
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye	
	
    But none returns. For us to levy power	
	
    But not my griefs; still am I king of those.	
	
    But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts	
	
    But now I see this one is one too much,	
	
    But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.	
	
    But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:	
	
    But on, my liege, for very little pains	
	
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,	
	
    But only they have privilege to live.	
	
    But pardon me. I do not in position	
	
    But rather lose her to an African;	
	
    But room, fairy, here comes Oberon.	
	
    But screw your courage to the sticking-place	
	
    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.	
	
    But shall be render'd to your public laws	
	
    But she would spell him backward. If fair-fac'd,	
	
    But since it would not, he had none of me.	
	
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,	
	
    But sorrow flouted at is double death.	
	
    But stay awhile; what company is this?	
	
    But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.	
	
    But sun it is not, when you say it is not;	
	
    But tell me whom thou seek'st.	
	
    But that I know them. Do they charge me further?	
	
    But that he was bound by a solemn oath?	
	
    But that my coat is better than thou know'st;	
	
    But that my resolution helps me. Milford,	
	
    But that the next heir should succeed and reign.	
	
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.	
	
    But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.	
	
    But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds	
	
    But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.	
	
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,	
	
    But there the Duke was given to understand	
	
    But they will quake and tremble all this day.	
	
    But this effusion of such manly drops,	
	
    But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old,	
	
    But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,	
	
    But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat	
	
    But though I am a daughter to his blood,	
	
    But three days longer, on the pain of death.	
	
    But to be rough, unswayable, and free.	
	
    But to make open proclamation.	
	
    But to support him after. Fare you well.	
	
    But under heavy judgement bears that life	
	
    But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's	
	
    But we will make it subject to this boy.	
	
    But welcome as you are. What shall we do?	
	
    But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell	
	
    But what see what see I? No Thisby do I see.	
	
    But what the repining enemy commends,	
	
    But whe'er I be as true begot or no,	
	
    But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,	
	
    But when your carters or your waiting-vassals	
	
    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain	
	
    But wherefore do you droop? Why look you sad?	
	
    But who comes here? I am invisible;	
	
    But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?	
	
    But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?	
	
    But with an angry waiter of your hand	
	
    But with good will. To show our simple skill,	
	
    But words are words; I never yet did hear	
	
    But yesternight; when all athwart there came	
	
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?	
	
    But yield me to the veriest hind that shall	
	
    But you are more intemperate in your blood	
	
    But you, my honourable lords, may name the time;	
	
    But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear	
	
    But, Rosaline, you have a favour too?	
	
    But, as it were, in sort or limitation,	
	
    But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,	
	
    But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy	
	
    But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed	
	
    But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal	
	
    But, mother, I am not Sir Robert's son:	
	
    But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,	
	
    But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture	
	
    But, soft! I think she comes, and I'll prepare	
	
    But, taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,	
	
    But, would you undertake another suit,	
	
    Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,	
	
    By Him that made us all, I am resolv'd	
	
    By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust	
	
    By all of us; and the fair soul herself	
	
    By any desperate change. My more particular,	
	
    By being once false for ever to be true	
	
    By circumstance but to acquit myself.	
	
    By deed-achieving honour newly nam'd-	
	
    By duty ruminated.	
	
    By false intelligence or wrong surmise,	
	
    By gentlemen at hand.	
	
    By heaven, I had rather coin my heart	
	
    By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;	
	
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,	
	
    By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly	
	
    By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd;	
	
    By lack of stooping-	
	
    By magic verses have contriv'd his end?	
	
    By means whereof his Highness hath lost France.	
	
    By my old beard,	
	
    By night frequents my house. I am a man	
	
    By our best eyes cannot be censured.	
	
    By revolution low'ring, does become	
	
    By self-example mayst thou be denied.	
	
    By some illusion see thou bring her here;	
	
    By such poor passion as the maid that milks	
	
    By th' heels, and suddenly; and on your heads	
	
    By that and all the rites of knighthood else	
	
    By the false faith of him whom most I trusted;	
	
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,	
	
    By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good	
	
    By their increase, now knows not which is which.	
	
    By this brave duke came early to his grave;	
	
    By this my issue's fail, and that gave to me	
	
    By those Welshwomen done as may not be	
	
    By underhand corrupted foul injustice,	
	
    By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to	
	
    By what we do to-night.	
	
    By words or blows here let us win our right.	
	
    By your leave.                                      [Knocks]	
	
    CHATILLON, ambassador from France to King John	
	
    Caesar and Antony have ever won	
	
    Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where	
	
    Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find anybody in the

    Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,	
	
    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!	
	
    Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;	
	
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose	
	
    Came here to make us merry! And thou hast kill'd him.	
	
    Came to my tent and cried on victory.	
	
    Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?	
	
    Can bide the beating of so strong a passion	
	
    Can cunning sin cover itself withal!	
	
    Can justly praise but what he does affect.	
	
    Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.	
	
    Can my sides hold, to think that man- who knows	
	
    Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.	
	
    Can truly say he gives, if he receives.	
	
    Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold	
	
    Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while	
	
    Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;	
	
    Cannot induce you to attend my words,	
	
    Cannot vouchsafe this burden, 'tis too weak	
	
    Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-lacks!

    Carriers, Travellers, and Attendants.

    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments	
	
    Castle.	
	
    Cesario, by the roses of the spring,	
	
    Chaos is come again.	
	
    Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and yet our horse not	
	
    Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance;	
	
    Chief factors for the gods: I do not know	
	
    Choose Caesar for their king.	
	
    Christian; and look if the fat villain have not transform'd him	
	
    Clamb'ring the walls to eye him; stalls, bulks, windows,	
	
    Clarence hath not another day to live;	
	
    Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest;	
	
    Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.	
	
    Clock to itself, knew the true minute when	
	
    Coal-black is better than another hue	
	
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,	
	
    Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.	
	
    Come down upon us with a mighty power,	
	
    Come here for physic.	
	
    Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen	
	
    Come in and give some help.	
	
    Come on, away. Apart upon our knees.	
	
    Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.	
	
    Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald;	
	
    Come to the Capitol.	
	
    Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life.	
	
    Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.	
	
    Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;	
	
    Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,	
	
    Come, come, sir.	
	
    Come, follow me, boy,. Come, sir boy, come follow me.	
	
    Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest;	
	
    Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,	
	
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,	
	
    Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.	
	
    Come, shall we go?	
	
    Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood:	
	
    Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends	
	
    Come.                                                 Exeunt

    Comes through commissions, which compels from each	
	
    Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,	
	
    Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,	
	
    Commend me to their loves; and I am proud, say, that my occasions	
	
    Commend the paper to his gracious hand;	
	
    Committing me unto my brother's love;	
	
    Compare our faces and be judge yourself.	
	
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.	
	
    Conceptions only proper to myself,	
	
    Condemning some to death and some to exile;	
	
    Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes	
	
    Confound them by some course, and come to me,	
	
    Confronted him with self-comparisons,	
	
    Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,	
	
    Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,	
	
    Constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?	
	
    Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,	
	
    Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!	
	
    Contriv'd by art and baleful sorcery.	
	
    Convert, o' th' instant, green virginity.	
	
    Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be	
	
    Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own	
	
    Could I with boot change for an idle plume	
	
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit	
	
    Could not all hell afford you such a devil?	
	
    Could put into them. My breeding was, sir, as	
	
    Could to no issue of true honour bring.	
	
    Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!	
	
    Courage and hope both teaching him the practice-

    Cousin, all honour to thee!

    Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal King!'	
	
    Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;	
	
    Cry.	
	
    Cunning in music and the mathematics,	
	
    Curs'd be I that did so! All the charms	
	
    Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.	
	
    Dale,a most furious knight and valorous enemy. But what of that?	
	
    Damn'd in the first beginners!- gan to look

    Dear Princess, were not his requests so far	
	
    Dear amity and everlasting love.	
	
    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;	
	
    Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.	
	
    Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,

    Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;	
	
    Descry a sail.	
	
    Desir'd more than constrain'd. To satisfy,

    Despised substance of divinest show!	
	
    Destroy'd his country, and his name remains	
	
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!	
	
    Devise the fittest time and safest way	
	
    Devoured by the unexpected flood.                 [The KING dies]	
	
    Did I expose myself, pure for his love,	
	
    Did I let pass th' abuse done to my niece?	
	
    Did Thisby fearfully o'ertrip the dew,	
	
    Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;	
	
    Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!	
	
    Did hear a challenge urg'd more modestly,	
	
    Did lack a parallel; yet, for all that,	
	
    Did never traitor in the land commit.	
	
    Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?	
	
    Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity	
	
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,	
	
    Did steer humanity. But you gods will give us	
	
    Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;	
	
    Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?	
	
    Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,	
	
    Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke	
	
    Die; perish. Might but my bending down	
	
    Digest this letter of the Cardinal's?	
	
    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!	
	
    Disclaiming here the kindred of the King;	
	
    Disdainful to be tried by't; 'tis not well.	
	
    Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth	
	
    Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness	
	
    Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,	
	
    Dispute not that; York is the worthier.	
	
    Distinguish him from others, he did keep	
	
    Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,	
	
    Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart	
	
    Do as I bid you do.	
	
    Do breed unnatural troubles; infected minds	
	
    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him	
	
    Do grace to Caesar's corse, and grace his speech	
	
    Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss;	
	
    Do love, prize, honour you.	
	
    Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?	
	
    Do not embrace me till each circumstance	
	
    Do not, in grant of all demands at large,	
	
    Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we	
	
    Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,	
	
    Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'	
	
    Do we not likewise see our learning there?	
	
    Do with so good a wife?	
	
    Do you damn others, and let this damn you,	
	
    Do't in your parents' eyes. Bankrupts, hold fast;	
	
    Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,	
	
    Does pity, as constrained blemishes,	
	
    Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet	
	
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife	
	
    Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee	
	
    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?	
	
    Dost thou not see my baby at my breast	
	
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.	
	
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.	
	
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?	
	
    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack	
	
    Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts	
	
    Doth teach me answers for deliverance!	
	
    Doting like me, and like me banished,	
	
    Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.	
	
    Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;	
	
    Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,	
	
    Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,	
	
    Drink the free air.	
	
    Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!	
	
    Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees	
	
    Ducks to the golden fool. All's oblique;	
	
    Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,	
	
    Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.	
	
    During the wars of York and Lancaster,	
	
    Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns-	
	
    Dying with mother's dug between its lips;	
	
    Each minute some.                                     Exeunt	
	
    Each one already blazing by our meeds,	
	
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.	
	
    Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,	
	
    Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons;	
	
    Effect it with some care, that he may prove	
	
    Either accept the title thou usurp'st,	
	
    Either for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,	
	
    Either of condemnation or approof,	
	
    Either to be restored to my blood,	
	
    Elected him our absence to supply;	
	
    Else would I have a fling at Winchester.	
	
    Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up	
	
    Employ'd you where high profits might come home,	
	
    Enclosed were they with their enemies.	
	
    Endure the winter's cold as well as he.	
	
    Enforce him with his envy to the people,	
	
    England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;	
	
    England, impatient of your just demands,	
	
    English, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the	
	
    Enow to press a royal merchant down,	
	
    Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,	
	
    Enter aloft SLY, with ATTENDANTS; some with apparel, basin	
	
    Enter the two KINGS, with their powers, at several doors	
	
    Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought	
	
    Envenom him with words, or get thee gone	
	
    Ere I again behold my Romeo!	
	
    Ere further leisure yicld them further means	
	
    Ere he express himself or move the people	
	
    Ere the leviathan can swim a league.	
	
    Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me	
	
    Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.	
	
    Ergo, thou liest.	
	
    Evades them, with a bumbast circumstance	
	
    Even as we are, to equal with the King.	
	
    Even at the heels in golden multitudes.	
	
    Even for the loss of thee, having no more,	
	
    Even in his garments, and did give himself,	
	
    Even in the chair of state! Belike he means,	
	
    Even in the matter of mine innocence;	
	
    Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last	
	
    Even now, now, very now, an old black ram	
	
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?	
	
    Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;	
	
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us	
	
    Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,	
	
    Even to my person, than I thought he would	
	
    Even to the utmost grain; that you shall read	
	
    Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,	
	
    Even with the same austerity and garb	
	
    Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,	
	
    Evils enow to darken all his goodness.	
	
    Exceed account. But the full sum of me	
	
    Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.	
	
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.	
	
    Exeunt	
	
    Expedient manage must be made, my liege,	
	
    Extended Asia from Euphrates,	
	
    FALSTAFF. Of what quality was your love, then?	
	
    Fail not to use, and with what vehemency	
	
    Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.	
	
    Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.	
	
    Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock I'll ring it;	
	
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,	
	
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I	
	
    False allegations to o'erthrow his state?	
	
    Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack	
	
    Fan you into despair! Have the power still	
	
    Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars	
	
    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!	
	
    Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet	
	
    Farewell, my sovereign.	
	
    Farewell. If heart's presages be not vain,	
	
    Fast to the chair. Be heedful; hence, and watch.	
	
    Fates open their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;	
	
    Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,	
	
    Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?	
	
    Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.	
	
    Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life	
	
    Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!	
	
    Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;	
	
    Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!	
	
    Fie on him! [Exit MARIA] Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from	
	
    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,	
	
    Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon	
	
    Find in myself no pity to myself?	
	
    Find we a time for frighted peace to pant	
	
    Finding yourself desir'd of such a person	
	
    Finely put on!	
	
    First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,	
	
    First, Provost, let me bail these gentle three.	
	
    First, he commends him to your noble self.	
	
    Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;	
	
    Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,	
	
    Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late	
	
    Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester	
	
    Fly not, stand still; ambition's debt is paid.	
	
    Foh, one may smell in such a will most rank,	
	
    Follow me.                                              Exit	
	
    Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years	
	
    Follows me everywhere, I know not why.	
	
    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard	
	
    For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.	
	
    For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'	
	
    For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.	
	
    For God's sake let us sit upon the ground	
	
    For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.	
	
    For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,	
	
    For I am sure you can wish none from me;	
	
    For I can give his humor the true bent,	
	
    For I do know Fluellen valiant,	
	
    For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.	
	
    For I have served him, and the man commands	
	
    For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,	
	
    For I must tell you friendly in your ear:	
	
    For I upon this bank will rest my head.	
	
    For I will make him tell the tale anew,	
	
    For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,	
	
    For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the	
	
    For Warwick bids you all farewell, to meet in heaven.	
	
    For a small vice.	
	
    For all my reign hath been but as a scene	
	
    For all your fair endeavours, and entreat,	
	
    For as the sun is daily new and old,	
	
    For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,	
	
    For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.	
	
    For both our honour and our shame in this	
	
    For by his face straight shall you know his heart.	
	
    For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.	
	
    For costs and charges in transporting her!	
	
    For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,	
	
    For each true word a blister, and each false	
	
    For ever by your Grace, whose hand has rais'd me.	
	
    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd	
	
    For every pelting petty officer	
	
    For false forswearing, and for murder too;	
	
    For fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience.	
	
    For good Lord Titus' innocence in all,	
	
    For half a hundred years. Summon the town.	
	
    For hateful deeds committed by myself!	
	
    For he is but a bastard to the time	
	
    For he is, sure, i' th' island.	
	
    For he was great of heart.	
	
    For henceforth of poor Claudio.	
	
    For here we need it not.	
	
    For high feats done to th' crown, neither allied	
	
    For his divisions, as the times do brawl,	
	
    For holy offices I have a time; a time	
	
    For if he be not one that truly loves you,	
	
    For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.	
	
    For in my youth I never did apply	
	
    For it excels your first; or if it did not,	
	
    For it is parting from us.	
	
    For it requires the royal debt it lent you.	
	
    For let the gods so speed me as I love	
	
    For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.	
	
    For many of our princes- woe the while!-	
	
    For mercy to his country. Therefore let's hence,	
	
    For mocking marriage with a dame of France.	
	
    For my part, I am so attir'd in wonder,	
	
    For my part, I'll resign unto your Grace	
	
    For never anything can be amiss	
	
    For never was a story of more woe	
	
    For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.	
	
    For nothing canst thou to damnation add	
	
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.	
	
    For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?	
	
    For our best act. If we shall stand still,	
	
    For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,	
	
    For policy sits above conscience.                     Exeunt	
	
    For recordation to my noble husband.	
	
    For shame! Leave Henry, and call Edward king.	
	
    For shape, for bearing, argument, and valour,	
	
    For since dishonour traffics with man's nature,	
	
    For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;	
	
    For so appears this fleet majestical,	
	
    For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.	
	
    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend	
	
    For such and so they are- these twenty years	
	
    For such things in a false disloyal knave	
	
    For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes.	
	
    For that I have laid by my majesty	
	
    For that I was his father Edward's son;	
	
    For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty	
	
    For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss	
	
    For the commodity that strangers have	
	
    For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,	
	
    For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.	
	
    For thee thrice wider than for other men-	
	
    For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,	
	
    For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.	
	
    For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome.	
	
    For they do prank them in authority,	
	
    For things that others do; and when we fall	
	
    For this affair. Some four or five attend him-	
	
    For this poor furniture and mean array.	
	
    For this they have engrossed and pil'd up	
	
    For those that were, it is not square to take,	
	
    For thou thyself hast been a libertine,	
	
    For though fond nature bids us all lament,	
	
    For though usurpers sway the rule a while	
	
    For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,	
	
    For too much loving you.	
	
    For truth to o'erpeer. Rather than fool it so,	
	
    For virtue and true beauty of the soul,	
	
    For we are soft as our complexions are,	
	
    For we would give much, to use violent thefts	
	
    For well we know no hand of blood and bone	
	
    For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done,	
	
    For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,	
	
    For when the King once heard it, out of anger	
	
    For where thou art, there is the world itself,	
	
    For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd	
	
    For which, if I be lapsed in this place,	
	
    For with a band of thirty thousand men	
	
    For wooing here until I sweat again,	
	
    For you are spell-stopp'd.	
	
    For you shall hence upon your wedding day.	
	
    For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother	
	
    For your expenses and sufficient charge,	
	
    For your own gifts make yourselves prais'd; but reserve still to	
	
    For, bear ourselves as even as we can,	
	
    For, by my fathers' reverend tomb, I vow	
	
    For, hearing this, I must perforce compound	
	
    For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,	
	
    For, meeting her of late behind the wood,	
	
    Forbid the sun to enter--like favourites,	
	
    Forbids to dwell upon; yet remember this:	
	
    Forerunning more requital.	
	
    Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!	
	
    Forgive me in thine own particular,	
	
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,	
	
    Form such another? This is the very top,	
	
    Fortune be a woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,	
	
    Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of	
	
    Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,	
	
    Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,	
	
    France friend with England; what becomes of me?	
	
    France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,	
	
    Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,	
	
    Freely to render what we have in charge;	
	
    Friend and companion in the front of war,	
	
    Frighting her pale-fac'd villages with war	
	
    From Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son	
	
    From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,	
	
    From any other foul unlawful touch	
	
    From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,	
	
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?	
	
    From forth the noise and rumour of the field,	
	
    From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;	
	
    From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,	
	
    From me receive that natural competency	
	
    From meaning treason to our royal person	
	
    From off my hands, here in the view of men	
	
    From out the circle of his territories.	
	
    From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck,	
	
    From so divine a temple to commix	
	
    From that great face of war, whose several ranges	
	
    From the great compt; but love that comes too late,	
	
    From the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth	
	
    From thence unto the place of execution:	
	
    From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?	
	
    From top of honour to disgrace's feet?	
	
    From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,	
	
    From where you do remain let paper show.	
	
    From which even here I slip my weary head	
	
    Fronting the sun, receives and renders back	
	
    Full of crusadoes; and, but my noble Moor	
	
    Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.	
	
    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.	
	
    Further I will not flatter you, my lord,	
	
    Gaoler, Servants, and other Attendants	
	
    Gave him defiance. But which of you was by-	
	
    Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?	
	
    Gentlemen of Windsor	
	
    Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.	
	
    Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;	
	
    Give entertainment to the might of it,	
	
    Give him the cup.	
	
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.	
	
    Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.	
	
    Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed	
	
    Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?	
	
    Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,	
	
    Give me your hand, Bassanio; fare you well.	
	
    Give order to my servants that they take	
	
    Give then such instances of loss?	
	
    Give us particulars of thy preservation;	
	
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.	
	
    Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,	
	
    Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull	
	
    Giving to you no further personal power	
	
    Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,	
	
    Go cheerfully together and digest	
	
    Go get you gone; and pray be careful all,	
	
    Go in, Bianca.                                   Exit BIANCA	
	
    Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,	
	
    Go seek him; tell him I would speak with him.	
	
    Go to Flint Castle; there I'll pine away;	
	
    Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;	
	
    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.	
	
    Go with your impositions, I am yours	
	
    Go, I charge thee, invite them all; let in the tide	
	
    Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;	
	
    Go, hop me over every kennel home,	
	
    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;	
	
    God b'uy, my lord; we came but to tell you	
	
    God bye you, Princes all; I'll to my charge.	
	
    God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee!	
	
    God pless your Majesty!	
	
    God put it in thy mind to take it hence,	
	
    God shield us!- a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing; for	
	
    God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.	
	
    God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.	
	
    Gone slightly o'er low steps, and now are mounted	
	
    Gonzago'?	
	
    Good Master Snare, let him not scape. 'A comes continuantly to	
	
    Good boy, wink at me, and say thou saw'st me not. Fare thee well.	
	
    Good cousin, give me audience for a while.	
	
    Good husband, let us every one go home,	
	
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you	
	
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.	
	
    Good uncle, help to order several powers	
	
    Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?	
	
    Govern the motion of a kingly eye.	
	
    Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,	
	
    Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy	
	
    Grave witnesses of true experience,	
	
    Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;	
	
    Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin;	
	
    Great men should drink with harness on their throats.	
	
    Greece. When thou art forth in the incursions, thou strikest as	
	
    Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!	
	
    Grounded upon no other argument	
	
    Guard me, beseech ye!	
	
    Guide thou the sword. [Pindarus stabs him.] Caesar, thou art	
	
    Ha, you gods! why this? What, this, you gods? Why, this	
	
    Had I expected thee.	
	
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.	
	
    Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!-	
	
    Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;	
	
    Had it our name, the value of one ten,	
	
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,	
	
    Had quite miscarried; I dare be bound again,	
	
    Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say	
	
    Had time coher'd with place, or place with wishing,	
	
    Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded	
	
    Half sleep, half waking; but as yet, I swear,	
	
    Halts not particularly, but moves itself	
	
    Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,	
	
    Hang thou there upon the tomb,	
	
    Happier the man whom favourable stars	
	
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;	
	
    Hark how Troy roars; how Hecuba cries out;	
	
    Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.         [Music plays]	
	
    Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.	
	
    Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.	
	
    Has a new master-Get a new man.	
	
    Has paid his men their wages. He ne'er drinks	
	
    Hast strangely stood the test; here, afore heaven,	
	
    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?	
	
    Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,	
	
    Hath Doreus prisoner,	
	
    Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest	
	
    Hath been as dear as Helen-I mean, of ours.	
	
    Hath blister'd her report. She is with child;	
	
    Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?	
	
    Hath for your love as great a pang of heart	
	
    Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine	
	
    Hath he set bounds between their love and me?	
	
    Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,	
	
    Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof	
	
    Hath lopp'd, and hew'd, and made thy body bare	
	
    Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?	
	
    Hath my maid's garments. He, upon some action,	
	
    Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.	
	
    Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf;	
	
    Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.	
	
    Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care	
	
    Hath spoken well and justly; therefore, madam,	
	
    Hath ta'en your part- to have so much to do	
	
    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,	
	
    Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head	
	
    Hath with the King's blood stain'd the King's own land.	
	
    Have I deserved at your Highness' hands.	
	
    Have I lik'd several women, never any	
	
    Have I since your departure had, my lords.	
	
    Have I with all my full affections	
	
    Have at thee.	
	
    Have batt'red me like roaring cannon-shot	
	
    Have brought about the annual reckoning.	
	
    Have chose as umpire of their mutiny.	
	
    Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice	
	
    Have fought with equal fortune, and continue	
	
    Have here up-swarm'd them.	
	
    Have hired me to undermine the Duchess,	
	
    Have left me naked to mine enemies.	
	
    Have lost their quality; and that this day	
	
    Have made you finish.	
	
    Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best	
	
    Have now the fatal object in my eye	
	
    Have practis'd dangerously against your state,	
	
    Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,	
	
    Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries	
	
    Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.	
	
    Have too a woman's heart, which ever yet	
	
    Have we march'd on without impediment;	
	
    Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desir'd	
	
    Have words to bid you; and shall find it so	
	
    Have you writ down that they are none?	
	
    Having been well, that would have made me sick,	
	
    Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.	
	
    Having the fearful flying hare in sight,	
	
    He and his lady both are at the lodge	
	
    He be approv'd in practice culpable.	
	
    He by the Senate is accited home,	
	
    He calls me to a restitution large	
	
    He comes to bad intent.	
	
    He commands us to provide and give great gifts,	
	
    He did behove his anger ere 'twas spent,	
	
    He did solicit you in free contempt	
	
    He does fair justice: if he give me way,	
	
    He finished indeed his mortal act	
	
    He flouted us downright.	
	
    He gave you all the duties of a man;	
	
    He had the wit which I can well observe	
	
    He hath a daily beauty in his life	
	
    He hath a stern look but a gentle heart.	
	
    He hath intent his wonted followers	
	
    He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.	
	
    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;	
	
    He is a very serpent in my way;	
	
    He is no less than what we say he is.	
	
    He is not here.	
	
    He is with Caesar.	
	
    He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't:	
	
    He like a puling cuckold would drink up	
	
    He little thought of this divided friendship.	
	
    He may a little grieve at.	
	
    He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;	
	
    He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;	
	
    He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry;	
	
    He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,	
	
    He pleaded still not guilty, and alleged	
	
    He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he;	
	
    He seek the life of any citizen,	
	
    He sent me hither, stranger as I am,	
	
    He shall have every day a several greeting,	
	
    He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;	
	
    He should not humor me. I will this night,	
	
    He should, for that, commit your godfathers.	
	
    He speaks by leave and by permission,	
	
    He tells us Arthur is deceas'd to-night.	
	
    He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring	
	
    He that no more must say is listen'd more	
	
    He then that is not furnish'd in this sort	
	
    He to be Earl Marshal. You may read the rest.	
	
    He was a thing of blood, whose every motion	
	
    He was much fam'd.	
	
    He was perfumed like a milliner,	
	
    He wears his honour in a box unseen	
	
    He will chastise me.	
	
    He will return; and hope I may that she,	
	
    He writes me here that inward sickness-	
	
    He'll call you to so hot an answer of it	
	
    He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,	
	
    He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.	
	
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,	
	
    He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer	
	
    Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.	
	
    Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!	
	
    Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give	
	
    Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arriv'd?	
	
    Hearing applause and universal shout,	
	
    Heave him away upon your winged thoughts	
	
    Heaven hath through me restor'd the King to health.	
	
    Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!	
	
    Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate,	
	
    Hector's great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens.	
	
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,	
	
    Helenus is a priest.	
	
    Help, ho!- Lieutenant- sir- Montano- sir-	
	
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,	
	
    Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd	
	
    Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,	
	
    Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy:	
	
    Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.	
	
    Her brother is in secret come from France;	
	
    Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;	
	
    Her father and her country and her friends,	
	
    Her hair, what colour?	
	
    Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;	
	
    Her motion and her station are as one;	
	
    Her pretty action did outsell her gift,	
	
    Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass,	
	
    Her times of preservation, which perforce	
	
    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,	
	
    Here I and sorrows sit;	
	
    Here at more leisure may your Highness read,	
	
    Here comes Navarre.	
	
    Here comes his Grace in person. My noble uncle!	
	
    Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot	
	
    Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,	
	
    Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd	
	
    Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up,	
	
    Here is a path to't; 'tis some savage hold.	
	
    Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad	
	
    Here lies our way.                                         Exeunt	
	
    Here on my knee I vow to God above	
	
    Here stands my other son, a banish'd man,	
	
    Here to make good the boist'rous late appeal,	
	
    Here's a petition from a Florentine,	
	
    Here's to Caesar!	
	
    Here's to thy health.	
	
    Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,	
	
    Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.	
	
    Hermes.	
	
    Herself's a bawd. Let not the virgin's cheek	
	
    Hides my heart. So, let me hear you speak.	
	
    High commendation, true applause, and love,	
	
    Him that thou magnifi'st with all these tides,	
	
    Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,	
	
    His Grace is ent'ring. Nay, you must not freeze:	
	
    His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!	
	
    His arms thus leagu'd. I thought he slept, and put	
	
    His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;	
	
    His broken promise, and to give this napkin,	
	
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,	
	
    His conquering banner shook from Syria	
	
    His daughter first; and then in sequel, all,	
	
    His dukedom and his chair with me is left.	
	
    His face still combating with tears and smiles,	
	
    His fault concludes but what the law should end,	
	
    His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?	
	
    His funerals shall not be in our camp,	
	
    His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,	
	
    His hand to wield a sceptre; and himself	
	
    His heart is fracted and corroborate.	
	
    His hour of speech a minute-he, my lady,	
	
    His liberty is full of threats to all-	
	
    His love too long ago! I am old, my lords,	
	
    His marches are expedient to this town,	
	
    His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,	
	
    His oath enrolled in the parliament;	
	
    His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?	
	
    His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;	
	
    His reasons with his body.	
	
    His ring I do accept most thankfully,	
	
    His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march;	
	
    His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:	
	
    His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves	
	
    His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.	
	
    His venom tooth will rankle to the death:	
	
    His wife is in Corioli, and his child	
	
    His wonders and his praises do contend	
	
    Hold hook and line, say I. Down, down, dogs! down, faitors! Have	
	
    Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.	
	
    Hold you the watch to-night?	
	
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,	
	
    Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.	
	
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,	
	
    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,	
	
    Hopkins, that made this mischief.	
	
    Horses did neigh and dying men did groan,	
	
    How God and good men hate so foul a liar.	
	
    How I may bear me here. My prime request,	
	
    How I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,	
	
    How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears;	
	
    How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths	
	
    How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?	
	
    How does he, sirrah?	
	
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that	
	
    How easily murder is discovered!	
	
    How easy is it then! Your constancy	
	
    How fine my master is! I am afraid	
	
    How goes our reck'ning?	
	
    How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,	
	
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,	
	
    How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!	
	
    How joyful am I made by this contract!	
	
    How like a younker or a prodigal	
	
    How many goodly creatures are there here!	
	
    How many of you have mine eyes beheld!	
	
    How modest in exception, and withal	
	
    How much in having, or without or in-	
	
    How much they do import, you would make haste.	
	
    How now! Is he dead?	
	
    How now! what news?	
	
    How now, Master Brook. Master Brook, the matter will	
	
    How now, my as fair as noble ladies- and the moon, were she	
	
    How now, what news?	
	
    How now? What news?	
	
    How often hast thou waited at my cup,	
	
    How say you, madam? Are ye so content?	
	
    How shall I honour thee for this success?	
	
    How show'd his tasking? Seem'd it in contempt?	
	
    How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!	
	
    How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness	
	
    How this Herculean Roman does become	
	
    How to live better. For your stubborn answer	
	
    How wert thou handled being prisoner?	
	
    How would it fare with your departed souls?	
	
    How you stand minded in the weighty difference	
	
    Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,	
	
    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,	
	
    Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive	
	
    Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,	
	
    I am a king that find thee; and I know	
	
    I am a man again. Pray you sit still.	
	
    I am a soldier and now bound to France.	
	
    I am an officer of state and come	
	
    I am as woeful as Virginius was,	
	
    I am asham'd. O heavens! what have I done?	
	
    I am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel;	
	
    I am fall'n indeed.	
	
    I am his brother, and I love him well.	
	
    I am hush'd until our city be afire,	
	
    I am left out; for me nothing remains.	
	
    I am no idle votarist. Roots, you clear heavens!	
	
    I am not in the giving vein to-day.	
	
    I am not worth this coil that's made for me.	
	
    I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his	
	
    I am so lated in the world that I	
	
    I am sure, is sent for.	
	
    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;	
	
    I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.	
	
    I am the turned forth, be it known to you,	
	
    I am to learn;	
	
    I am with both: each army hath a hand;	
	
    I am your butt, and I abide your shot.	
	
    I and my sword will earn our chronicle.	
	
    I be not found a talker.	
	
    I beg the law, the law upon his head.	
	
    I bleed inwardly for my lord.                           Exit	
	
    I came into the world with my legs forward.	
	
    I came to her from Claudio, and desir'd her	
	
    I can no longer hold me patient.                 [Advancing]	
	
    I can with ease translate it to my will;	
	
    I cannot but remember such things were	
	
    I cannot justify whom the law condemns.	
	
    I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms	
	
    I cannot tell-	
	
    I caus'd you write yet sent away?	
	
    I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,	
	
    I come by note, to give and to receive.	
	
    I come to visit the afflicted spirits	
	
    I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,	
	
    I could have well diverted her intents,	
	
    I could not find him at the Elephant;	
	
    I cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish	
	
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,	
	
    I dare your worst objections. If I blush,	
	
    I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart; but	
	
    I did present him with the Paris balls.	
	
    I do arrest thee of high treason here.	
	
    I do beseech you, know me.	
	
    I do engage my life.	
	
    I do entreat you, not a man depart,	
	
    I do not fly; but advantageous care	
	
    I do not so secure me in the error,	
	
    I do not think but Desdemona's honest.	
	
    I do repent it from my very soul.	
	
    I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade	
	
    I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:	
	
    I evermore did love you, Hermia,	
	
    I fast and pray'd for their intelligence- thus:	
	
    I fear the Emperor means no good to us.	
	
    I feel my master's passion! This slave	
	
    I feel too much thy blessing. Make it less,	
	
    I followed fast, but faster he did fly,	
	
    I found her trimming up the diadem	
	
    I gave thee life and rescu'd thee from death.	
	
    I go to certify her Talbot's here.	
	
    I grant I am a woman, but withal	
	
    I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!	
	
    I had in charge at my depart for France,	
	
    I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,	
	
    I had rather have my wounds to heal again	
	
    I had thought I had had men of some understanding	
	
    I have a heart as little apt as yours,	
	
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze	
	
    I have been broad awake two hours and more.	
	
    I have been talking with a suitor here,	
	
    I have bewept a worthy husband's death,	
	
    I have disclaim'd Sir Robert and my land;	
	
    I have forgot my part and I am out,	
	
    I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs,	
	
    I have known my husband; yet my husband	
	
    I have made my way through more impediments	
	
    I have more charity; but say I warned ye.	
	
    I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.	
	
    I have not known when his affections sway'd	
	
    I have one word to say to you. Look you, my good lord,	
	
    I have perform'd my task, and was espous'd;	
	
    I have seen and heard of; for your voices have	
	
    I have spoke already, and it is provided;	
	
    I have the placing of the British crown.	
	
    I have travell'd but two hours.	
	
    I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,	
	
    I hear the King my father is sore sick.	
	
    I here renounce him and return to Henry.	
	
    I hold me highly honoured of your Grace,	
	
    I hope she will deserve well-and a little	
	
    I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir-	
	
    I kiss his conquring hand. Tell him I am prompt	
	
    I know Anne's mind for that; never a woman in Windsor	
	
    I know but of a single part in aught	
	
    I know it by thy trembling; now Prosper works upon thee.	
	
    I know no pain they can inflict upon him	
	
    I know not what. 'Tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis here,	
	
    I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the	
	
    I know thy constellation is right apt	
	
    I know you would be prouder of the work	
	
    I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,	
	
    I led them on in this distracted fear,	
	
    I live with bread like you, feel want,	
	
    I lost my liberty, and they their lives.	
	
    I love thee more and more; think more and more	
	
    I made a little fault in Great.	
	
    I make you both Protectors of this land,	
	
    I may not prove inferior to yourself.	
	
    I mean that married her, alack, good man!	
	
    I mean to take possession of my right.	
	
    I meant to rectify my conscience, which	
	
    I muse you make so slight a question.	
	
    I must away this night toward Padua,	
	
    I must be ripp'd. To pieces with me! O,	
	
    I must needs say you have a little fault.	
	
    I must offend before I be attainted;	
	
    I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!	
	
    I never gave you aught.	
	
    I never read but England's kings have had	
	
    I never swore this lady such an oath.	
	
    I never yet beheld that special face	
	
    I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,	
	
    I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.	
	
    I pray you be acquainted with this maid;	
	
    I pray you stand good father to me now;	
	
    I pray you, school yourself. But for your husband,	
	
    I prithee grieve to make me merry, York.	
	
    I prithee turn aside and weep for her;	
	
    I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;	
	
    I purpose not to wait on fortune till	
	
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days	
	
    I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.	
	
    I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.	
	
    I saw the handkerchief.	
	
    I saw't this morning; confident I am	
	
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.	
	
    I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,	
	
    I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.	
	
    I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years	
	
    I seek to heal it only by his wealth.	
	
    I shall attend your leisure; but make haste;	
	
    I shall be satisfied.	
	
    I shall give worse payment.	
	
    I shall not want false witness to condemn me	
	
    I shall unfold equal discourtesy	
	
    I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,	
	
    I should have been beholding to your paper.	
	
    I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'	
	
    I should love thee but as a property.	
	
    I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros	
	
    I slew him not, but to my own disgrace	
	
    I speak not 'Be thou true' as fearing thee,	
	
    I speak of peace while covert emnity,	
	
    I stand dishonour'd that have gone about	
	
    I stood engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd	
	
    I swear he is true-hearted, and a soul	
	
    I talk of you:	
	
    I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.	
	
    I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths	
	
    I thank thee for myself.	
	
    I that am cruel am yet merciful;	
	
    I therefore apprehend and do attach thee	
	
    I think it is. And doth affection breed it?	
	
    I think upon't, I think, I smell't, O villainy!	
	
    I think, to liberty. Yet am I better	
	
    I thought upon Antonio when he told me,	
	
    I thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated	
	
    I took by the throat the circumcised dog	
	
    I trembling wak'd, and for a season after	
	
    I understand thy kisses, and thou mine,	
	
    I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next	
	
    I was advertis'd their great general slept,	
	
    I was my chamber's prisoner.	
	
    I was too young that time to value her,	
	
    I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in	
	
    I will assume thy part in some disguise	
	
    I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold,	
	
    I will be married to a wealtlly widow	
	
    I will be very kind, and liberal	
	
    I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd;	
	
    I will discase me, and myself present	
	
    I will encounter darkness as a bride	
	
    I will from hence to-day.	
	
    I will go eat with thee, and see your knights.	
	
    I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours, which	
	
    I will most willingly attend your ladyship.	
	
    I will not entertain so bad a thought.	
	
    I will not fail her; speak it privately.	
	
    I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,	
	
    I will not taint my mouth with.	
	
    I will repeal thee or, be well assur'd,	
	
    I will resolve you herein presently.                    Exit	
	
    I will tell no tales.	
	
    I will your serious and great business scant	
	
    I wish I could be made so many men,	
	
    I with the Morning's love have oft made sport;	
	
    I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.	
	
    I would be trebled twenty times myself,	
	
    I would have left it on the board, so soon	
	
    I would invent as bitter searching terms,	
	
    I would not be ambitious in my wish	
	
    I would not for the world.	
	
    I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.	
	
    I would not tell you what I would, my lord.	
	
    I would prove-	
	
    I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,	
	
    I would wish me only he.	
	
    I would, while it was smiling in my face,	
	
    I' th' dungeon by a snuff?	
	
    I' th' right and strength o' th' commons' be it either	
	
    I' th' war do grow together; grant that, and tell me	
	
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind	
	
    I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,	
	
    I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful	
	
    I'll bring mine action on the proudest he	
	
    I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,	
	
    I'll charm the air to give a sound,	
	
    I'll do thee service for so good a gift.	
	
    I'll draw the form and model of our battle,	
	
    I'll fetch the general's surgeon. [To Bianca.] For you, mistress,	
	
    I'll follow you and tell what answer	
	
    I'll give my barony. Never talk of it.	
	
    I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne;	
	
    I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak	
	
    I'll hence to London on a serious matter;	
	
    I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,	
	
    I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other	
	
    I'll lop a member off and give it you	
	
    I'll make a peace between your soul and you.	
	
    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,	
	
    I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace	
	
    I'll not believe't.	
	
    I'll not endure him.	
	
    I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.	
	
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,	
	
    I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,	
	
    I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,	
	
    I'll send him certain word of my success.	
	
    I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'	
	
    I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.               Exit	
	
    I'll take her to my guard.	
	
    I'll tell thee more of this another time.	
	
    I'll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy;	
	
    I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.                  Exit	
	
    I'll undertake may see away their shilling	
	
    I'll willingly to him; to gain his colour	
	
    I'll write to him a very taunting letter,	
	
    I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,	
	
    I, to comfort him, bid him 'a should not think of God; I hop'd	
	
    I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty	
	
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one	
	
    If Henry were recall'd to life again,	
	
    If I can catch him once upon the hip,	
	
    If I could temporize with my affections	
	
    If I do not put on a sober habit,	
	
    If I forgive him!	
	
    If I may counsel you, some day or two	
	
    If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,	
	
    If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,	
	
    If Marcius should be join'd wi' th' Volscians-	
	
    If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,	
	
    If after three days' space thou here be'st found	
	
    If any think brave death outweighs bad life	
	
    If brothers. [Aside] Would it had been so that they	
	
    If consequence do but approve my dream,	
	
    If ever I did dream of such a matter,	
	
    If ever he have wife, let her be made	
	
    If for the last, say 'Ay,' and to it, lords.	
	
    If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.	
	
    If he be chaste, the flame will back descend,	
	
    If he for gold will give us any food;	
	
    If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.	
	
    If he were known alive?	
	
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided	
	
    If in your country wars you chance to die,	
	
    If it be so, out with it boldly, man;	
	
    If it would please him come and marry her!'	
	
    If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,	
	
    If my suspect be false, forgive me, God;	
	
    If not Achilles? Though 't be a sportful combat,	
	
    If not to bless us and the land withal,	
	
    If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.	
	
    If once it be neglected, ten to one	
	
    If one good deed in all my life I did,	
	
    If seriously I may convey my thoughts	
	
    If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day	
	
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.	
	
    If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores o' sorel.	
	
    If that my cousin king be King in England,	
	
    If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,	
	
    If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.      Wounds Iago.	
	
    If the first hour I shrink and run away.	
	
    If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,	
	
    If they can brook I bow a knee to man.	
	
    If they perceive dissension in our looks	
	
    If they will fight with us, bid them come down	
	
    If this salute my blood a jot; it faints me	
	
    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire	
	
    If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear	
	
    If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,	
	
    If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,	
	
    If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.	
	
    If thou stand excommunicate and curs'd?	
	
    If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not	
	
    If thy unworthiness raised love in me,	
	
    If trembling I inhabit then, protest me	
	
    If we be not, show us the hand of God	
	
    If well-respected honour bid me on	
	
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,	
	
    If you advise it.	
	
    If you are bound to us or no. What say you?	
	
    If you deny it, let the danger light	
	
    If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.	
	
    If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,	
	
    If you have stomach. The general state, I fear,	
	
    If you say ay, the King will not say no.                   Exeunt	
	
    If you think meet, this afternoon will post	
	
    If you will make 't an action, call witness to 't.	
	
    If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,	
	
    If zealous love should go in search of virtue,	
	
    If, rather than to marry County Paris	
	
    Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.	
	
    Immoment toys, things of such dignity	
	
    Impatiently I burn with thy desire;	
	
    Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my	
	
    Improvident soldiers! Had your watch been good	
	
    In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make	
	
    In Hector's wrath.	
	
    In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,	
	
    In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks	
	
    In all designs begun on earth below	
	
    In all humility unto his Highness;	
	
    In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon;	
	
    In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful	
	
    In aught he merit not.	
	
    In blood of those that had encount'red him.	
	
    In brief, for so the season bids us be,	
	
    In characters as red as Mars his heart	
	
    In conflict, that you get the sun of them.	
	
    In craving your opinion of my tide,	
	
    In deepest consequence-	
	
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,	
	
    In earnest of a further benefit,	
	
    In election for the Roman empery	
	
    In every place save here in Italy.	
	
    In favour was my brother; and he went	
	
    In fellest manner execute your arms.	
	
    In gait and countenance surely like a father.	
	
    In goodly form comes on the enemy;	
	
    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,	
	
    In him that was of late an heretic,	
	
    In his own conduct, purposely to take	
	
    In honour follows Coriolanus.	
	
    In it be memoriz'd.	
	
    In levity. Since which time of five years	
	
    In little room confining mighty men,	
	
    In making question of my uttermost	
	
    In memory of her, when she is dead,	
	
    In most accepted pain.	
	
    In my heart's love hath no man than yourself.	
	
    In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, "Indeed!"	
	
    In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,	
	
    In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you:	
	
    In parcels as I did, would have gone near	
	
    In peace, and part this body and my soul	
	
    In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion	
	
    In private will I talk with thee apart.	
	
    In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;	
	
    In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd	
	
    In right and service of their noble country.	
	
    In shadow of such greatness! With you, Lord Bishop,	
	
    In sign of what you are, not to reward	
	
    In sooth, he might; then, if he were my brother's,	
	
    In spite of Pope or dignities of church,	
	
    In such a business give me leave to use	
	
    In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,	
	
    In such disdainful manner me to woo.	
	
    In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis	
	
    In that one woman I have lost for ever.	
	
    In the Rialto you have rated me	
	
    In the dead vast and middle of the night	
	
    In the great'st humbleness, and desir'd your Highness	
	
    In the preferment of the eldest sister.	
	
    In the rare semblance that I lov'd it first.	
	
    In the unpartial judging of this business.	
	
    In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.	
	
    In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance	
	
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,	
	
    In this close walk to satisfy myself	
	
    In this fine age were not thought flattery,	
	
    In this your cousin's death.	
	
    In thy dumb action will I be as perfect	
	
    In to my tent; the dew is raw and cold.	
	
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,	
	
    In what part of your body pleaseth me.	
	
    In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;	
	
    In whom the title rested, were suppress'd.	
	
    In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,	
	
    In your own losses, if he stay in France.	
	
    Incens'd the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,	
	
    Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;	
	
    Induce you to the question on't, or ever	
	
    Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires	
	
    Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,	
	
    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,	
	
    Insisting on the old prerogative	
	
    Intend here to besiege you in your castle.	
	
    Into a cloven pine; within which rift	
	
    Into an auger's bore.	
	
    Into my private meditations?	
	
    Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,	
	
    Into the flame.	
	
    Into the main of waters. Music! hark!	
	
    Into this chiefest thicket of the park.	
	
    Into your favor.	
	
    Invites the King of England's stay at home;	
	
    Is 'husband' in my mouth! even for that name,	
	
    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?	
	
    Is all the grace I beg.	
	
    Is all your strict preciseness come to this?	
	
    Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,	
	
    Is but a little way above our heads,	
	
    Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,	
	
    Is crept into the palace of our King,	
	
    Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake	
	
    Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian-	
	
    Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.	
	
    Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid	
	
    Is he dead, my Ethiopian? Is he dead, my Francisco? Ha,	
	
    Is held from falling with so weak a wind	
	
    Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;	
	
    Is it your trick to make me ope the door,	
	
    Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,	
	
    Is likely to beget more conquerors,	
	
    Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.	
	
    Is my strict fast-I mean my children's looks;	
	
    Is not his Grace Protector to the King?	
	
    Is not the causer of the timeless deaths	
	
    Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,	
	
    Is now a widower.	
	
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;	
	
    Is only bitter to him, only dying,	
	
    Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,	
	
    Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome	
	
    Is richly furnished with plate and gold,	
	
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?	
	
    Is so possess'd with guilt. Come from thy ward;	
	
    Is still a dying horror!	
	
    Is that he was the lord ambassador	
	
    Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire	
	
    Is the desire that's glorious. Blessed be those,	
	
    Is the young Dauphin every way complete-	
	
    Is this exaction?	
	
    Is this the man that you did tell us of?	
	
    Is this the witness, friar?	
	
    Is to come in.	
	
    Is to th' court, and there ye shall be my guests:	
	
    Is valiant and dejected; and by starts	
	
    Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits	
	
    Is yond despis'd and ruinous man my lord?	
	
    Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women	
	
    Is't not your trick?	
	
    It be to do thee service.	
	
    It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.	
	
    It comes from Padua, from Bellario;	
	
    It did take place, 'I do' quoth he 'perceive	
	
    It draws toward supper in conclusion so.	
	
    It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee	
	
    It hath been taught us from the primal state	
	
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'	
	
    It is a dropsied honour. Good alone	
	
    It is against my will; for I desire	
	
    It is an earnest of a further good	
	
    It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,	
	
    It is impossible to bear it out.	
	
    It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour.	
	
    It is not worth leave-taking.	
	
    It is our safety, and we must embrace	
	
    It is the law, not I condemn your brother.	
	
    It is to see a nobleman want manners.	
	
    It is too hard a knot for me t' untie!                  Exit	
	
    It may be death.	
	
    It may be thought we held him carelessly,	
	
    It must appear in other ways than words,	
	
    It nothing ill becomes thee.	
	
    It sends some precious instance of itself	
	
    It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,	
	
    It shall become thee well to act my woes:	
	
    It speaks against her with the other proofs.	
	
    It stands in like request?	
	
    It useth an enforced ceremony.	
	
    It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,	
	
    It was wise nature's end in the donation,	
	
    It were a shame to let this land by lease;	
	
    It will be seen to-morrow. My long sickness	
	
    It will outrun you, father, in the end.	
	
    It's fit this royal session do proceed	
	
    Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.

    Jaquenetta's, and that 'a wears next his heart for a favour.	
	
    John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,	
	
    John. You owe me money, Sir John, and now you pick a quarrel to	
	
    Join with me to forbid him her resort;	
	
    Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!	
	
    Judge when you hear. But, soft, what nymphs are these?	
	
    Justice to break her sword! One more, one more;	
	
    Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am glad thou	
	
    Keep in your bosom; yet remain assur'd	
	
    Keep there; now talk at pleasure of your safety.	
	
    Keeps good old York there with his men of war?	
	
    Keeps place with thought, and almost, like the gods,	
	
    Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,	
	
    Kindled with unchaste desire,	
	
    King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear

    Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,	
	
    Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.	
	
    Knowing that with the shadow of his wings	
	
    Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.	
	
    Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.	
	
    Laertes before you fall to play.	
	
    Laid them before you; you would throw them off

    Leave procreants alone and shut the door;	
	
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,	
	
    Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,	
	
    Legitimation, name, and all is gone.	
	
    Lend me thy handkerchief.

    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd	
	
    Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while	
	
    Let her alone; speak not of Helena;	
	
    Let him be call'd for.	
	
    Let him fear this; for it will come to pass	
	
    Let him not seek't of us. By day and night!	
	
    Let him that thinks of me so abjectly	
	
    Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle	
	
    Let it not, Brutus.	
	
    Let me be no assistant for a state,	
	
    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?	
	
    Let me excuse me, and believe me so,	
	
    Let me in safety raise me from my knees,	
	
    Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!	
	
    Let me o'erleap that custom; for I cannot

    Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;	
	
    Let not our looks put on our purposes,	
	
    Let not your hate encounter with my love,	
	
    Let senses rule. The word is 'Pitch and Pay.'	
	
    Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,	
	
    Let them not live to taste this land's increase	
	
    Let us address to tend on Hector's heels.	
	
    Let us be back'd with God, and with the seas	
	
    Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.	
	
    Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,	
	
    Let what is here contain'd relish of love,	
	
    Let's away,	
	
    Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.	
	
    Let's not confound the time with conference harsh;	
	
    Let's reason with the worst that may befall.	
	
    Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;	
	
    Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.	
	
    Lie further off, in human modesty;	
	
    Lies all within. Deliver me the key;	
	
    Lies foul with chaw'd grass, still and motionless;	
	
    Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale	
	
    Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress.	
	
    Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands	
	
    Like a good parent, did beget of him	
	
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;	
	
    Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head;	
	
    Like bubbles ill a late-disturbed stream,	
	
    Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch.	
	
    Like humble-visag'd suitors, his high will.	
	
    Like one that comes here to besiege his court,	
	
    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,	
	
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;	
	
    Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp	
	
    Like to a dismal clangor heard from far,	
	
    Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring;	
	
    Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand	
	
    Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.	
	
    Listen to me, and if you speak me fair	
	
    Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets,	
	
    Live thou, I live. With much much more dismay	
	
    Lives not this day within the city walls.	
	
    Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears	
	
    Lo, in this right hand, whose protection	
	
    Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,	
	
    London.                                               Exeunt	
	
    Long in his Highness' favour, and do justice	
	
    Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,	
	
    Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read	
	
    Look how we can, or sad or merrily,	
	
    Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,	
	
    Look to it, lords; let not his smoothing words	
	
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.	
	
    Look where they come!	
	
    Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.	
	
    Look, as I blow this feather from my face,	
	
    Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks	
	
    Looks in a glass that shows what future evils-	
	
    Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,	
	
    Lord Paris?	
	
    Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the	
	
    Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,	
	
    Lord?	
	
    Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest.	
	
    Love and languish for his sake.	
	
    Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;	
	
    Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.	
	
    Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!	
	
    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;	
	
    Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can	
	
    Lysander! What, remov'd? Lysander! lord!	
	
    Macbeth doth come.	
	
    Mad and fantastic execution,	
	
    Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;	
	
    Made Lud's Town with rejoicing fires bright	
	
    Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,	
	
    Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,	
	
    Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,	
	
    Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,	
	
    Made to write "whore" upon? What committed?	
	
    Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,	
	
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,	
	
    Make but my name thy love, and love that still,	
	
    Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence,	
	
    Make it so known.	
	
    Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body	
	
    Make not too rash a trial of him, for	
	
    Make such unconstant children of ourselves,	
	
    Make the prize light.  [To FERDINAND]  One word more; I	
	
    Make this his latest farewell to their souls.	
	
    Make we our march towards Birnam.           Exeunt marching.	
	
    Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen- your son	
	
    Makes him oppose himself against his king.	
	
    Makes me most forward in this princely presence	
	
    Makes the night morning and the noontide night.	
	
    Making both it unable for itself	
	
    Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.	
	
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,	
	
    Manage this war.	
	
    Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought	
	
    Marcellus?	
	
    March to the bridge, it now draws toward night;	
	
    Marian, I say! a stoup of wine.	
	
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters	
	
    Mark it, Cesario; it is old and plain;	
	
    Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was	
	
    Marry, before your ladyship I grant,	
	
    Maskers, Torchbearers, Pages, Guards, Watchmen, Servants, and	
	
    Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger	
	
    Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old	
	
    Masters, lay down your weapons.	
	
    May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?	
	
    May be absolv'd in English.	
	
    May cease their hatred; and this dear conjunction	
	
    May fright the hopeful mother at the view,	
	
    May give you thankful sacrifice!	
	
    May know if you remain upon this island;	
	
    May make some stronger head- the which he hearing,	
	
    May pierce the head of the great combatant,	
	
    May read strange matters. To beguile the time,	
	
    May show her duty and make known her love?'	
	
    May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!	
	
    May yet ere night yield both my life and them	
	
    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:	
	
    Mean to establish Caesar as a king,	
	
    Meaning the King at Pomfret. Come, let's go.	
	
    Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?	
	
    Meet I an infant of the house of York,	
	
    Melancholy.	
	
    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;	
	
    Men must learn now with pity to dispense;	
	
    Men's evil manners live in brass: their virtues	
	
    Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two	
	
    Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither	
	
    Messina.	
	
    Methinks I see this hurly all on foot;	
	
    Methinks the power that Edward hath in field	
	
    Methought a serpent eat my heart away,	
	
    Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling	
	
    Might be affronted with the match and weight	
	
    Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!	
	
    Might liquid tears, or heart-offending groans,	
	
    Might with effects of them follow our friends	
	
    Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!	
	
    Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.	
	
    Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,	
	
    Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.	
	
    Mine speak of seventy senators that died	
	
    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.	
	
    Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish; I would thy	
	
    Misuse the tenour of thy kinsman's trust?	
	
    Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,	
	
    Montagues.	
	
    More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before.	
	
    More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;	
	
    More free from peril than the envious court?	
	
    More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.	
	
    More mild, but yet more harmful-kind in hatred.	
	
    More needs she the divine than the physician.	
	
    More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;	
	
    More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,	
	
    More than I love these eyes, more than my life,	
	
    More than Octavius and Mark Antony	
	
    More than it is, ere foul sin gathering head	
	
    More than my father's skill, which was the great'st	
	
    More than to see this ring. Take him away.	
	
    More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.	
	
    More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,	
	
    More worthy this place than myself; to whom,	
	
    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.	
	
    Most fit for business. Go make thee ready;	
	
    Most lamentable day, most woful day	
	
    Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,	
	
    Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;	
	
    Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope	
	
    Most wrongfully accus'd your substitute;	
	
    Mov'd with compassion of my country's wreck,	
	
    Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop	
	
    Much less to take occasion from their mouths	
	
    Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,	
	
    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,	
	
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.	
	
    Must answer for your raising? I know her well:	
	
    Must be digested; give a favour from you,	
	
    Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.	
	
    Must end that work the ides of March begun.	
	
    Must get a father, call'd suppos'd Vincentio;	
	
    Must kings neglect that private men enjoy!	
	
    Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.	
	
    Must not in haste abuse- if it be true,	
	
    Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve	
	
    My Alcibiades.- With me? What is your will?	
	
    My Lord Sandys.	
	
    My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,	
	
    My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,	
	
    My babes were destin'd to a fairer death,	
	
    My banquet is to close our stomachs up	
	
    My body shall make good upon this earth,	
	
    My brain, more busy than the labouring spider,	
	
    My brother might not claim him; nor your father,	
	
    My charms crack not, my spirits obey; and time	
	
    My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,	
	
    My damned son that thy two sweet sons smother'd.	
	
    My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase	
	
    My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.	
	
    My dukedom since you have given me again,	
	
    My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.	
	
    My father and Glendower being both away,	
	
    My father gave me honour, yours gave land.	
	
    My father's land, as was my father's will.	
	
    My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,	
	
    My foes I do repute you every one;	
	
    My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.	
	
    My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.	
	
    My grained ash an hundred times hath broke	
	
    My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg'd	
	
    My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.	
	
    My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.	
	
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.	
	
    My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,	
	
    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;	
	
    My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,	
	
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate	
	
    My lips are no common, though several they be.	
	
    My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,	
	
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.	
	
    My lords, if not for any parts in him-	
	
    My love and her desert; that canst not dream	
	
    My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;	
	
    My master's a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I	
	
    My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;	
	
    My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled	
	
    My music playing far off, I will betray	
	
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.	
	
    My noble grapes, an if my royal fox	
	
    My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,	
	
    My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope	
	
    My purpose would prove well. It cannot be	
	
    My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,	
	
    My reverence, calling, nor divinity,	
	
    My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,	
	
    My sleep my death?	
	
    My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.	
	
    My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!	
	
    My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.	
	
    My surname, Coriolanus. The painful service,	
	
    My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,	
	
    My thought, whose murther yet is but fantastical,	
	
    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,	
	
    My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad.	
	
    My very heart at root.	
	
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times	
	
    My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,	
	
    My word and promise to the Emperor	
	
    Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.	
	
    Myself hath often heard them say-	
	
    Myself have heard a voice to call him so.	
	
    Myself would on the rearward of reproaches	
	
    Myself, well-mounted, hardly have escap'd.	
	
    Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.	
	
    Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,	
	
    Nay, come, let's go together.	
	
    Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge	
	
    Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image,	
	
    Nay, stay not to expostulate; make speed;	
	
    Nay;	
	
    Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see	
	
    Near to the King in blood, and near in love	
	
    Necessitied to help, that by this token	
	
    Neither supreme, how soon confusion	
	
    Nerissa there her clerk. Lorenzo here	
	
    Never presented!- O, a root! Dear thanks!-	
	
    Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.	
	
    Never to speak to lady afterward	
	
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:	
	
    Newly preferr'd from the King's secretary;	
	
    Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,	
	
    No better a musician than the wren.	
	
    No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you	
	
    No deeper wrinkles yet? Hath sorrow struck	
	
    No further harm.	
	
    No great offence belongs to't, give your friend	
	
    No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance	
	
    No longer for my flatterer; he is drown'd	
	
    No masque to-night; the wind is come about;	
	
    No more can I be severed from your side	
	
    No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.	
	
    No natural exhalation in the sky,	
	
    No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.	
	
    No prophet will I trust if she prove false.           Exeunt	
	
    No sooner had they told this hellish tale	
	
    No stricter render of me than my all.	
	
    No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where	
	
    No! yet time serves wherein you may redeem	
	
    No, Leonato,	
	
    No, if thou dost say no to my demand.	
	
    No, it will hang upon my richest robes	
	
    No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man	
	
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,	
	
    No. Know the gallant monarch is in arms	
	
    No; let my father seek another heir.	
	
    Non eget Mauri iaculis, nec arcu.'	
	
    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.	
	
    Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself	
	
    Nor as we are, we say, we will not shun it.	
	
    Nor can one England brook a double reign	
	
    Nor construe any further my neglect	
	
    Nor conversant with ease and idleness,	
	
    Nor faint in the pursuit.	
	
    Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,	
	
    Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter	
	
    Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?	
	
    Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth;	
	
    Nor moody beggars, starving for a time	
	
    Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart	
	
    Nor never look upon each other's face;	
	
    Nor once deject the courage of our minds	
	
    Nor shall not now; for in companions	
	
    Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death	
	
    Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt.	
	
    Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke	
	
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.	
	
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,	
	
    Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;	
	
    Nor you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,	
	
    Norway himself, with terrible numbers,	
	
    Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel;	
	
    Not all thy counsel.	
	
    Not by a public minister of justice,	
	
    Not cowardly put off my helmet to	
	
    Not for their own demerits, but for mine,	
	
    Not knowing why.	
	
    Not like to me, or any of my kin,	
	
    Not meaning to partake with me in danger,	
	
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,	
	
    Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered.	
	
    Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.	
	
    Not that I have the power to clutch my hand	
	
    Not to come off, in his displeasure.	
	
    Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,	
	
    Not unconsidered leave your honour nor	
	
    Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,	
	
    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day	
	
    Nothing but odds with England. To that end,	
	
    Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title	
	
    Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.	
	
    Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.	
	
    Now am I like that proud insulting ship	
	
    Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?	
	
    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:	
	
    Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits	
	
    Now forth, Lord Constable and Princes all,	
	
    Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy;	
	
    Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;	
	
    Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:	
	
    Now let him speak; 'tis charity to show.                Exit	
	
    Now march we hence. Discharge the common sort	
	
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead	
	
    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.	
	
    Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea	
	
    Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?	
	
    Now to that name my courage prove my title!	
	
    Now will I charge you in the band of truth,	
	
    Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?	
	
    Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.	
	
    Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,	
	
    Now, by mine honour, by my life, my troth,	
	
    Now, fellows, you are welcome.	
	
    Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.	
	
    Now, my Lord Constable!	
	
    Now, sir,	
	
    Now, ye familiar spirits that are cull'd	
	
    O Antony! O Antony!                                   [Dies]	
	
    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?	
	
    O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse	
	
    O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,	
	
    O cousin, cousin!	
	
    O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,	
	
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!	
	
    O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,	
	
    O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new	
	
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death	
	
    O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?	
	
    O my Lord Aberga'ny, fare you well!	
	
    O noble English, that could entertain	
	
    O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem	
	
    O sure I am the wits of former days,	
	
    O that men's ears should be	
	
    O thou fond many, with what loud applause	
	
    O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!	
	
    O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,	
	
    O' my troth, most sweet jests, most incony vulgar wit!	
	
    O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice	
	
    O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds	
	
    O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!	
	
    O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine!	
	
    O, I should have a heavy miss of thee	
	
    O, call back yesterday, bid time return,	
	
    O, come, Ventidius,	
	
    O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,	
	
    O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.	
	
    O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!	
	
    O, know you yet He doth it publicly.	
	
    O, let the vile world end	
	
    O, make a league with me, till I have pleas'd	
	
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;	
	
    O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,	
	
    O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,	
	
    O, stay!  [Aside]  I have no power to let her pass;	
	
    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do	
	
    O, they did urge it still unto the King!	
	
    O, vengeance!	
	
    O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!	
	
    O, what a world of vile ill-favour'd faults	
	
    O, wither'd is the garland of the war,	
	
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I	
	
    Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember	
	
    Of 'came, and saw, and overcame.' With shame-	
	
    Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.	
	
    Of Charles his father.	
	
    Of France and England, whose very shores look pale	
	
    Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!	
	
    Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;	
	
    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,	
	
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal	
	
    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;	
	
    Of all the gentry. There is Seward's son	
	
    Of all the world I lov'd, and to him put	
	
    Of an unthrifty knave, and presently	
	
    Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen	
	
    Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me.	
	
    Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!            Exeunt	
	
    Of burning Rome.	
	
    Of capital treason we arrest you here.	
	
    Of contradiction; being once chaf'd, he cannot	
	
    Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.	
	
    Of divers witnesses; which the Duke desir'd	
	
    Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel	
	
    Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.	
	
    Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.	
	
    Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.	
	
    Of great revenue, and she hath no child-	
	
    Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich	
	
    Of health and living now begins to mend,	
	
    Of him I was about to call his father-	
	
    Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless;	
	
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,	
	
    Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain	
	
    Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound!	
	
    Of late with passions of some difference,	
	
    Of leigers for her sweet; and which she after,	
	
    Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.	
	
    Of many our contriving friends in Rome	
	
    Of more arrivance.	
	
    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd	
	
    Of my lord's health, of his content; yet not	
	
    Of my wive's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,	
	
    Of nature's germaines tumble all together	
	
    Of old I know them; rather with their teeth	
	
    Of one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn	
	
    Of our rank feud; but the just gods gainsay	
	
    Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,	
	
    Of present dues. The future comes apace;	
	
    Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tent,	
	
    Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow, and of teen!	
	
    Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.	
	
    Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,	
	
    Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune	
	
    Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;	
	
    Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.	
	
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.	
	
    Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm	
	
    Of the last monarchy-see that you come	
	
    Of the old rage; bear with me, I am sick;	
	
    Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,	
	
    Of their own choice. One's Junius Brutus-	
	
    Of these Italian weeds, and suit myself	
	
    Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,	
	
    Of this man to be vex'd?	
	
    Of this oppressed boy; this is thy eldest son's son,	
	
    Of this young Percy's pride? The prisoners	
	
    Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,	
	
    Of treasonous malice.	
	
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.	
	
    Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,	
	
    Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw-	
	
    Of what is to be dreaded.	
	
    Of whom he had this ring.	
	
    Of whom you seem to have so tender care?	
	
    Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy-	
	
    Of your accustom'd diligence to me.	
	
    Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;	
	
    Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.	
	
    Offend you, and obey you, as I did.	
	
    Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,	
	
    Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,	
	
    Olympus-high, and duck again as low	
	
    On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took	
	
    On all that need. Let me report to him	
	
    On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,	
	
    On height of our displeasure. Friend or brother,	
	
    On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?	
	
    On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee	
	
    On pain to be found false and recreant,	
	
    On that advantage, bought with such a shame,	
	
    On the forefinger of an alderman,	
	
    On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.	
	
    On those that are, revenge: crimes, like lands,	
	
    On whom there is no more dependency	
	
    On you than any, so your hand and heart,	
	
    Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold	
	
    Once more, adieu; be valiant, and speed well!	
	
    One Michael Cassio, a Florentine	
	
    One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom	
	
    One hundred twenty-six; added to these,	
	
    One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;	
	
    One of the greatest in the Christian world	
	
    One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;	
	
    One that in all obedience makes the church	
	
    One that still motions war and never peace,	
	
    One way or other, she is for a king;	
	
    Only a show or two, and so agree	
	
    Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and	
	
    Only this proof I'll of thy valour make	
	
    Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin	
	
    Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,	
	
    Oppos'd to hinder me, should stop my way,	
	
    Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'	
	
    Or I am much deceiv'd, of Portia.	
	
    Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;	
	
    Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.	
	
    Or any token of thine honour else,	
	
    Or as thy father and his father did,	
	
    Or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods.	
	
    Or breed itself so out of circumstances,	
	
    Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.	
	
    Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;	
	
    Or did it from his teeth.	
	
    Or do I dream? Or have I dream'd till now?	
	
    Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.	
	
    Or else he seeks out us.	
	
    Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!	
	
    Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still,	
	
    Or else you get no beef of Grumio.	
	
    Or ever but in vizards show their faces?	
	
    Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells	
	
    Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all	
	
    Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is	
	
    Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.	
	
    Or if he were not privy to those faults,	
	
    Or if thou hast not broke from company	
	
    Or is he but retir'd to make him strong?	
	
    Or know not what we are.	
	
    Or less than a just pound- be it but so much	
	
    Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,	
	
    Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.	
	
    Or more than any living man could bear.	
	
    Or nature makes me suddenly relent.	
	
    Or pack to their old playfellows. There, I take it,	
	
    Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.	
	
    Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,	
	
    Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?	
	
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,	
	
    Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,	
	
    Or than for strength and safety of our country.	
	
    Or that we women had men's privilege	
	
    Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,	
	
    Or thy precedent services are all	
	
    Or wallow naked in December snow	
	
    Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.	
	
    Or whether that the body public be	
	
    Or with their blood stain this discoloured shore.	
	
    Or wrath or craft may get him.	
	
    Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.	
	
    Or, if he do, let it at least be said	
	
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,	
	
    Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth	
	
    Ordain'd our laws- whose use the sword of Caesar	
	
    Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;	
	
    Our Empress' shame and stately Rome's disgrace!	
	
    Our Roman hunting.	
	
    Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts	
	
    Our bloods are now in calm; and so long health!	
	
    Our cause that she should lie i' th' bosom of	
	
    Our comfort in the country. We must find	
	
    Our dance of custom round about the oak	
	
    Our duty this way lies. For God's sake, come.	
	
    Our father's tears despis'd, and basely cozen'd	
	
    Our great competitor. From Alexandria	
	
    Our hard-rul'd King. Again, there is sprung up	
	
    Our house is hell; and thou, a merry devil,	
	
    Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.	
	
    Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,	
	
    Our most persisted deeds.	
	
    Our neighbour shepherd's son!	
	
    Our people and our peers are both misled,	
	
    Our project's life this shape of sense assumes-	
	
    Our reasons laid before him-hath commanded	
	
    Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,	
	
    Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight	
	
    Our swifter composition.	
	
    Our thighs with wax, our mouths with honey pack'd,	
	
    Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.	
	
    Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,	
	
    Out of a foreign wisdom-renouncing clean	
	
    Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.	
	
    Out of mine own; his days and times are past,	
	
    Out of one side her happy minion,	
	
    Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,	
	
    Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.	
	
    Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose,	
	
    Out, loathed med'cine! O hated potion, hence!	
	
    Out-go my thinking on you.	
	
    Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind	
	
    Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty-

    Pluck the grave wrinkled Senate from the bench	
	
    Pluck'd four away. [To BOLINGBROKE] Six frozen winters spent,	
	
    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.	
	
    Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,	
	
    Poor lady, she were better love a dream.	
	
    Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;	
	
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!	
	
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.	
	
    Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart-	
	
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour	
	
    Pray you go fit you to the custom, and	
	
    Pray'rs and tears have mov'd me, gifts could never.	
	
    Preferment goes by letter and affection,	
	
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;	
	
    Preserve the King!                               [They wake]	
	
    Presuming on an ague's privilege,	
	
    Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,	
	
    Prince Troilus, I have lov'd you night and day	
	
    Princess of England, Elizabeth!	
	
    Prithee let's walk. Now, by my holidame,	
	
    Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;	
	
    Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer	
	
    Procure me some access.	
	
    Produce his body to the marketplace,	
	
    Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen	
	
    Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!          Exeunt	
	
    Protector	
	
    Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,	
	
    Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life	
	
    Provided that my banishment repeal'd	
	
    Prunes the immortal wing, and cloys his beak,	
	
    Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!	
	
    Pursue each other, or shall they be divided	
	
    Put colour in thy cheek.	
	
    Put on a most importunate aspect,	
	
    Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may,	
	
    Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,	
	
    QUEEN ELINOR, widow of King Henry II and mother to	
	
    Queen. O, confound the rest!	
	
    Question enrages him. At once, good night.	
	
    Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.	
	
    Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.	
	
    Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come	
	
    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.	
	
    Ratcliff, thyself-or Catesby; where is he?	
	
    Rated mine uncle from the Council board;	
	
    Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!	
	
    Raze out the written troubles of the brain,	
	
    Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy, and	
	
    Rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it:	
	
    Receiv'd deep scars in France and Normandy?	
	
    Receive it from me, then: war and confusion	
	
    Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,	
	
    Refuse you for my judge, whom yet once more	
	
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,	
	
    Release my brother; and, after much debatement,	
	
    Remains in danger of her former tooth.	
	
    Remember in my prayers.	
	
    Remembrance of my father-in-law, the Duke,	
	
    Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.	
	
    Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,	
	
    Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.	
	
    Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;	
	
    Reports the Volsces with several powers	
	
    Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.	
	
    Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,	
	
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.	
	
    Rests by you only to be qualified.	
	
    Return the precedent to these lords again,	
	
    Returns us thanks.	
	
    Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.	
	
    Reviving blood, and that great men shall press	
	
    Rich pearls upon thee.	
	
    Rich scarf to my proud earth-why hath thy Queen	
	
    Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart	
	
    Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send	
	
    Right true it is your son Lucentio here	
	
    Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.	
	
    Robs me of that which not enriches him	
	
    Roderigo? No- yes, sure. O heaven! Roderigo.	
	
    Rome, be as just and gracious unto me	
	
    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;	
	
    Rosalind, if you will.	
	
    Rot half a grain a day! He lies to the heart.	
	
    Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto's snake,	
	
    Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if	
	
    Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege	
	
    SECOND LORD. O, 'tis brave wars!	
	
    SERVILIUS	
	
    Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains	
	
    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,	
	
    Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets	
	
    Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest	
	
    Save men's opinions and my living blood	
	
    Save these in bonds. Let them be joyful too,	
	
    Save you your labor. He that lies slain here, Cassio,	
	
    Saw her abed, and in the morning early	
	
    Say 'the brave Antony.'	
	
    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.	
	
    Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,	
	
    Say that you love me not; but say not so	
	
    Say you not, then, our offer is compell'd.	
	
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?	
	
    Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,	
	
    Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins	
	
    Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away;	
	
    Scorn'dst our brain's flow, and those our droplets which	
	
    Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd	
	
    Second a villain and a murderer?	
	
    Seducing so my friends; and to this end	
	
    See how this river comes me cranking in	
	
    See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd	
	
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;	
	
    See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.	
	
    See, see the pining malady of France;	
	
    Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,	
	
    Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands	
	
    Seem to break loose- take on as you would follow,	
	
    Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!	
	
    Seems to prepare his way. So let him land,	
	
    Self-loving-	
	
    Send danger from the east unto the west,	
	
    Send out more horses, skirr the country round,	
	
    Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,	
	
    Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came.	
	
    Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.	
	
    Set from our o'er-match'd forces forth for aid.	
	
    Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.	
	
    Set them into confounding odds, that beasts	
	
    Shadowing their right under your wings of war.	
	
    Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,	
	
    Shakes so my single state of man that function	
	
    Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?	
	
    Shall I send to thee?	
	
    Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,	
	
    Shall be crown'd in Brutus.	
	
    Shall be no shelter to these outrages;	
	
    Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?	
	
    Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.	
	
    Shall chide your trespass and return your mock	
	
    Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle:	
	
    Shall enter me with him.	
	
    Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.	
	
    Shall furnish me to those Italian fields	
	
    Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper,	
	
    Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd	
	
    Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;	
	
    Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,	
	
    Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,	
	
    Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power	
	
    Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.	
	
    Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.	
	
    Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;	
	
    Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.	
	
    Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her,	
	
    Shall tax my fears of little vanity,	
	
    Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;	
	
    Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,	
	
    Shall win the wager which we will propose.	
	
    Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,	
	
    Shallow, be what thou wilt- I am Fortune's steward. Get on thy	
	
    Shame come to Romeo!	
	
    Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue	
	
    She came adorned hither like sweet May,	
	
    She do defeat us; for her life in Rome	
	
    She hath betray'd me, and shall die the death.	
	
    She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite	
	
    She is a woman, therefore to be won.	
	
    She is not fourteen. How long is it now	
	
    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,	
	
    She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;	
	
    She may do more, sir, than denying that:	
	
    She must, the saints must have her-yet a virgin;	
	
    She shall be priz'd. But that you say 'Be't so,'	
	
    She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.	
	
    She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,	
	
    She was a charmer, and could almost read	
	
    She was a widow.	
	
    She whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores	
	
    She would applaud Andronicus' conceit.	
	
    She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.            Exit	
	
    She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,	
	
    Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body.	
	
    Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius	
	
    Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?	
	
    Should be infused with so foul a spirit!	
	
    Should be the father of some stratagem.	
	
    Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double-damn'd;	
	
    Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,	
	
    Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt	
	
    Should not be able to encounter mine.	
	
    Should perish by the sword! And I myself,	
	
    Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,	
	
    Should the approach of this wild river break,	
	
    Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,         [Digging]	
	
    Show boldness and aspiring confidence.	
	
    Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time	
	
    Show'r'd on me daily, have been more than could	
	
    Shut door upon me, and so give me up	
	
    Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,	
	
    Signifying nothing.	
	
    Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,	
	
    Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,	
	
    Since I have made my friends at peace on earth.	
	
    Since I must lose the use of all deceit?	
	
    Since arms avail not, now that Henry's dead.	
	
    Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.	
	
    Since not to be avoided it fails on me.	
	
    Since presently your souls must part your bodies-	
	
    Since the first sword was drawn about this question,	
	
    Since thou hast far to go, bear not along	
	
    Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,	
	
    Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband-	
	
    Sir Hugh. Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student	
	
    Sir John. Unless you go out disguis'd.	
	
    Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman	
	
    Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,	
	
    Sir, in this audience,	
	
    Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men	
	
    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.	
	
    Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.	
	
    Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven	
	
    Sits in grim majesty to fright the world.	
	
    Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,	
	
    Slay! Let not a traitor live!	
	
    Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!            [Sleeps]	
	
    Slept in his face, and rend'red such aspect	
	
    Small joy have I in being England's Queen.	
	
    Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony	
	
    So 'twere not long of him; but being ent'red,	
	
    So Caesar shall not find them.	
	
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,	
	
    So at his sight away his fellows fly;	
	
    So brainsickly of things. Go, get some water	
	
    So can I name his faults.	
	
    So cowardly; and but for these vile 'guns,	
	
    So did he turn, and over Suffolk's neck	
	
    So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle	
	
    So far I read aloud;	
	
    So far exceed all instance, all discourse,	
	
    So follow to be most unlike our courtiers,	
	
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,	
	
    So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin	
	
    So great as our dread father's, in a scale	
	
    So hath your Highness; never King of England	
	
    So honour peereth in the meanest habit.	
	
    So is it in the music of men's lives.	
	
    So it be new, there's no respect how vile-	
	
    So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus	
	
    So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,	
	
    So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood	
	
    So many horrid ghosts. O, now, who will behold	
	
    So many of his shadows thou hast met,	
	
    So mighty and so many my defects,	
	
    So much as but to prop him?	
	
    So much for that. Now for our Irish wars.	
	
    So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.	
	
    So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,

    So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.	
	
    So shall we stay, mocking intended game,	
	
    So should we save a valiant gentleman	
	
    So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,	
	
    So strongly guarded.  [To ARTHUR]  Cousin, look not sad;	
	
    So sure I swear to get the town or die.	
	
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,	
	
    So that his power, like to a fangless lion,	
	
    So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.	
	
    So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain.	
	
    So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.	
	
    So turns she every man the wrong side out	
	
    So vulgarly and personally accus'd-

    So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing,	
	
    So, now I have mine own again, be gone.

    Than now to see you here an iron man,	
	
    Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink	
	
    Than some that have accus'd them wear their hats.	
	
    Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been

    Than you much willing to be counted wise	
	
    Than your good words. But who comes here?	
	
    That Angelo's a murderer, is't not strange?	
	
    That Caesar and his Senate must redress?	
	
    That Christendom gives out.	
	
    That Douglas and the English rebels met	
	
    That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,	
	
    That I advise your shunning.	
	
    That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.	
	
    That I am wise. I must have liberty	
	
    That I did never, no, nor never can,	
	
    That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;	
	
    That I have pass'd.	
	
    That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,	
	
    That I may give the local wound a name,	
	
    That I may live and say 'The dog is dead.'	
	
    That I may strive to kill it with a groan.	
	
    That I must call't in question.	
	
    That I myself have done unto myself?	
	
    That I shall make this Northern youth exchange	
	
    That I should questionless be fortunate.	
	
    That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths	
	
    That I yet know not?	
	
    That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,	
	
    That Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles	
	
    That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds,	
	
    That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens,	
	
    That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.            Exit	
	
    That all the court may echo with the noise.	
	
    That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks	
	
    That an invisible instinct should frame them	
	
    That anything he sees which moves his liking	
	
    That apprehends no further than this world,	
	
    That are your prisoners-	
	
    That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves	
	
    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,	
	
    That bids me be of comfort any more.	
	
    That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,	
	
    That both should speed?	
	
    That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.	
	
    That by direct or indirect attempts	
	
    That came too lag to see him buried.	
	
    That cannot see this palpable device?	
	
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,	
	
    That charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say.	
	
    That comes to hazard for my worthless self.	
	
    That could not live asunder day or night.	
	
    That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,	
	
    That did display them when we first march'd forth;	
	
    That did renew old AEson.	
	
    That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people,	
	
    That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods!	
	
    That done, dissever your united strengths	
	
    That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.	
	
    That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,	
	
    That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?	
	
    That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff,	
	
    That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,	
	
    That ever ear did hear to such effect;	
	
    That ever swore her faith.	
	
    That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.	
	
    That every stride he makes upon my land	
	
    That fashion'd others. And him- O wondrous him!	
	
    That fears him much, and my misgiving still	
	
    That fools should be so deep contemplative;	
	
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!	
	
    That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring	
	
    That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,	
	
    That girdles in those wolves, dive in the earth	
	
    That goddess blind,	
	
    That grew the more by reaping. His delights	
	
    That grudge one thought against your Majesty!	
	
    That hand which had the strength, even at your door.	
	
    That has no relish of salvation in't-	
	
    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!	
	
    That hath her husband banish'd. O, that husband!	
	
    That hath so long been resident in France?	
	
    That have my heart parted betwixt two friends,	
	
    That he believes himself; so do not I.	
	
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed	
	
    That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land	
	
    That he is too familiar with his wife.	
	
    That he shall shrink under my courtesy.	
	
    That he should come about your royal person	
	
    That he will give them make I as little question	
	
    That he would steal away so guilty-like,	
	
    That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.	
	
    That highly may advantage thee to hear;	
	
    That his own hand may strike his honour down	
	
    That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,	
	
    That if requiring fail, he will compel;	
	
    That in cross-ways and floods have burial,	
	
    That in the sty of the most deadly boar	
	
    That in your country's service drew your swords;	
	
    That is another's lawful promis'd love.                 Exit	
	
    That is my brother's plea, and none of mine;	
	
    That is the word. I thee defy again.	
	
    That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter	
	
    That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,	
	
    That it is place which lessens and sets off;	
	
    That it shall please you to declare in hearing	
	
    That justice seizes. What knows the laws	
	
    That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.	
	
    That lack of means enforce you not to evils;	
	
    That led calm Henry, though he were a king,	
	
    That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,	
	
    That liv'd amongst men.	
	
    That livest to make thine honesty a vice!	
	
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea	
	
    That loves his mistress more than in confession	
	
    That majesty, to keep decorum, must	
	
    That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.	
	
    That man i' th' world who shall report he has	
	
    That matter needless, of importless burden,	
	
    That men are merriest when they are from home.	
	
    That men shall swear I have discontinued school	
	
    That mine own use invites me to cut down,	
	
    That most pure spirit of sense-behold itself,	
	
    That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!	
	
    That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,	
	
    That need must needs infer this principle-	
	
    That never knew but better, is some burden.	
	
    That no compunctious visitings of nature	
	
    That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,	
	
    That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?	
	
    That now hath seiz'd them; why, they were no worse	
	
    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.	
	
    That only wounds by hearsay.	
	
    That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,	
	
    That owe yourselves, your lives, and services,	
	
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.	
	
    That present med'cine must be minist'red	
	
    That put Armado's page out of his part!	
	
    That rheumatic diseases do abound.	
	
    That rids our dogs of languish?	
	
    That says his bravery is not on my cost,	
	
    That seems disgracious in the city's eye,	
	
    That severs day from night.	
	
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,	
	
    That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.	
	
    That she belov'd knows nought that knows not this:	
	
    That she shall have, besides an argosy	
	
    That she was never yet that ever knew	
	
    That should deracinate such savagery;	
	
    That since the common men are now in action	
	
    That skins the vice o' th' top. Go to your bosom,	
	
    That smooth'st it so with King and commonweal.	
	
    That so neglected you.	
	
    That speak my salutation in their minds,	
	
    That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,	
	
    That stir the King against the Duke my brother.	
	
    That strew the green lap of the new come spring?	
	
    That such a valiant company are fled.	
	
    That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass	
	
    That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.	
	
    That taught his son the office of a fowl!	
	
    That the fix'd sentinels almost receive	
	
    That the land Salique is in Germany,	
	
    That the united vessel of their blood,	
	
    That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,	
	
    That there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves,	
	
    That these great tow'rs, trophies, and schools, should fall	
	
    That they may break his foaming courser's back	
	
    That they shall think we are accomplished	
	
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth	
	
    That this may be some error, but no madness,	
	
    That this same paper brings you.	
	
    That thou attend me; thou dost here usurp	
	
    That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,	
	
    That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.	
	
    That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.	
	
    That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,	
	
    That thus we die while remiss traitors sleep.	
	
    That time, acquaintance, custom, and condition,	
	
    That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.	
	
    That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,	
	
    That two such noble peers as ye should jar!	
	
    That very oft we pity enemies.	
	
    That walk'd about me every minute-while;	
	
    That warranteth by law to be thy privilege:	
	
    That we are those which chas'd you from the field,	
	
    That we come short of our suppose so far	
	
    That we have had no time to move our daughter.	
	
    That we meet here so strangely; but her son	
	
    That we shall hardly in our ages see	
	
    That we, like savages, may worship it.	
	
    That were a state fit for his holiness.	
	
    That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes	
	
    That what he will he does, and does so much	
	
    That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible	
	
    That which none else can utter. By this marriage	
	
    That whiles Verona by that name is known,	
	
    That will take pains to blow a horn before her?	
	
    That winter should cut off our spring-time so.	
	
    That with the King here resteth in his tent?	
	
    That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,	
	
    That would to cinders burn up modesty,	
	
    That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.	
	
    That you are like to Sir Vincentio.	
	
    That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state,	
	
    That you extol me thus?	
	
    That you have in her, bid her answer truly.	
	
    That you know well. Something it is I would-	
	
    That you shall stifle in your own report,	
	
    That you start at it? I say I am your mother,	
	
    That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.	
	
    That your poor friends must woo your company?	
	
    That's done-as near as the extremest ends	
	
    That's thousand to one good one- when you now see	
	
    That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,	
	
    That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts	
	
    That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,	
	
    That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit	
	
    That, like a rude and savage man of Inde	
	
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.	
	
    That, were my state far worser than it is,	
	
    That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth	
	
    The Archbishop's Grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer	
	
    The Bishop will be overborne by thee.	
	
    The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset	
	
    The Dauphin rages at our very heels.	
	
    The Duke himself, and the magnificoes	
	
    The Duke of Suffolk?	
	
    The Duke's in council, and your noble self,	
	
    The Earl of Hereford was reputed then	
	
    The Emperor's court is like the house of Fame,	
	
    The Grecians' cause.	
	
    The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.	
	
    The King had cut off my head with my brother's.	
	
    The King hath yielded unto thy demand:	
	
    The King my father shall be made acquainted	
	
    The King was weeping-ripe for a good word.	
	
    The King's disease-my project may deceive me,	
	
    The King, your father, was reputed for	
	
    The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong.	
	
    The Noble Percy slain and all his men	
	
    The Prince draws it out and finds it to he a bottle of sack.	
	
    The Provost knows our purpose and our plot.	
	
    The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word	
	
    The Senate's courtesy? Let deeds express	
	
    The Welshmen are dispers'd; and Salisbury	
	
    The accent of his tongue affecteth him.	
	
    The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam	
	
    The appetite may sicken and so die.	
	
    The army marvell'd at it; and, in the last,	
	
    The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart	
	
    The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps	
	
    The beachy girdle of the ocean	
	
    The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces	
	
    The best-regarded virgins of our clime	
	
    The better part of my affections would

    The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:	
	
    The boy gives warning something doth approach.	
	
    The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,	
	
    The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.	
	
    The cares I give I have, though given away;	
	
    The cause betwixt her and this great offender.	
	
    The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;	
	
    The circle of my glory.	
	
    The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.	
	
    The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.	
	
    The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,	
	
    The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack,	
	
    The complot of this timeless tragedy;	
	
    The constant service of the antique world,	
	
    The country base than to commit such slaughter;	
	
    The court awards it and the law doth give it.	
	
    The cruel father and his traitorous sons,	
	
    The dam will wake; and if she wind ye once,	
	
    The dateless limit of thy dear exile;	
	
    The day will come that thou shalt wish for me	
	
    The deeds of justest men.	
	
    The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster; if he be a whoremonger,	
	
    The different plague of each calamity.	
	
    The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind	
	
    The dreadful motion of a murderous thought	
	
    The dust that did offend it.	
	
    The edge of that day's celebration,	
	
    The empire of the sea; our slippery people,	
	
    The enterprise is sick! How could communities,	
	
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay	
	
    The fairest grant is the necessity.

    The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus	
	
    The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy	
	
    The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;	
	
    The full cause of our coming.	
	
    The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,	
	
    The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me	
	
    The glory of our Troy doth this day lie	
	
    The gods, not the patricians, make it, and

    The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,	
	
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,	
	
    The harvest is your own.	
	
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.	
	
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks	
	
    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;	
	
    The help of mine own eyes.	
	
    The history of all her secret thoughts.	
	
    The honourable board of council out,	
	
    The horrible conceit of death and night,	
	
    The image of a wicked heinous fault	
	
    The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.	
	
    The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,	
	
    The issue is embracement. Ajax, farewell.	
	
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out	
	
    The knee before him, and returns in peace	
	
    The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,	
	
    The last true duties of thy noble son!	
	
    The last was I that felt thy tyranny.	
	
    The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,	
	
    The least of which haunting a nobleman	
	
    The liberal opposition of our spirits,	
	
    The light and careless livery that it wears	
	
    The like of him. Know'st thou this country?	
	
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty	
	
    The love of wicked men converts to fear;	
	
    The maid is fair, o' th' youngest for a bride,	
	
    The manage of my state; as at that time	
	
    The manner how this action hath been borne	
	
    The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,	
	
    The matter's in my head and in my heart;	
	
    The measure, then, of one is eas'ly told.	
	
    The mere effusion of thy proper loins,	
	
    The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?	
	
    The moment on't; fort must be done tonight	
	
    The moon, methinks, looks with a wat'ry eye;	
	
    The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.	
	
    The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge	
	
    The murderers, EXTON and servants, rush in, armed	
	
    The name thou ow'st not; and hast put thyself	
	
    The nature of an insurrection.	
	
    The nature of their crimes, that I may minister	
	
    The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;	
	
    The noble Brutus, thrusting this report	
	
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.	
	
    The noblest; and do now not basely die,	
	
    The nonpareil of beauty!	
	
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,	
	
    The one as long as the other. 'Tis pity of him.	
	
    The one my duty owes; but my fair name,	
	
    The other down, unseen, and full of water.	
	
    The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth.	
	
    The other, that he do record a gift,	
	
    The painting is almost the natural man;	
	
    The pangs of barr'd affections, though the King	
	
    The passion of loud laughter never shed.	
	
    The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,	
	
    The peril of our curses fight on thee	
	
    The period of thy tyranny approacheth.	
	
    The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn	
	
    The poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill.	
	
    The practice of it lives in John the bastard,	
	
    The present consul and last general	
	
    The presentation of but what I was,	
	
    The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,	
	
    The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,	
	
    The quaint musician, amorous Licio-	
	
    The rabble should have first unroof'd the city	
	
    The rate of usance here with us in Venice.	
	
    The record of what injuries you did us,	
	
    The rest I'd give to be to you translated.	
	
    The revenue whereof shall furnish us	
	
    The reverent care I bear unto my lord	
	
    The rites for which I love him are bereft me,	
	
    The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!'	
	
    The satisfaction of her knowledge only	
	
    The sea enraged is not half so deaf,	
	
    The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster.	
	
    The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,	
	
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life	
	
    The shadow of your face.	
	
    The shes of Italy should not betray	
	
    The sides of loyalty, and almost appears	
	
    The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.	
	
    The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown,	
	
    The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;	
	
    The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls	
	
    The source of all erection. There's more gold.	
	
    The spacious world cannot again afford;	
	
    The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands	
	
    The stealth of our most mutual entertainment,	
	
    The story of that baleful burning night,	
	
    The strongest nerves and small inferior veins	
	
    The suit which you demand is gone and dead:	
	
    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.	
	
    The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,	
	
    The sweat of industry would dry and die	
	
    The temple-haunting martlet, does approve	
	
    The thankings of a king.	
	
    The thing we sue for.	
	
    The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp	
	
    The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.	
	
    The time of night when Troy was set on fire;	
	
    The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,	
	
    The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,	
	
    The triumph of his pledge.	
	
    The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,	
	
    The truth is then most done not doing it;	
	
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn	
	
    The unseen good old man.	
	
    The usurper's cursed head. The time is free.	
	
    The venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast;	
	
    The very bottom and the soul of hope,	
	
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes	
	
    The very tyranny and rage of his.	
	
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,	
	
    The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshak'd	
	
    The wanton stings and motions of the sense,	
	
    The way that they did and to grin like lions	
	
    The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;	
	
    The which in every language I pronounce,	
	
    The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,	
	
    The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer	
	
    The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees	
	
    The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd	
	
    The world affords no law to make thee rich;	
	
    The world may read in me; my body's mark'd	
	
    The worst that may befall me in this case,	
	
    The worthy Leonatus is in safety,	
	
    The youthful Phoebus.	
	
    Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,	
	
    Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,	
	
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;	
	
    Their deer to th' stand o' th' stealer; and 'tis gold	
	
    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;	
	
    Their loud applause and Aves vehement;	
	
    Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd	
	
    Their pangs of love, with other incident throes	
	
    Their royal blood enchaf'd, as the rud'st wind	
	
    Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up	
	
    Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets	
	
    Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?	
	
    Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine, fill full.	
	
    Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,	
	
    Then do we sin against our own estate	
	
    Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why-	
	
    Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.         Exit	
	
    Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?	
	
    Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth	
	
    Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss,	
	
    Then let not him be slandered with revolt.	
	
    Then mark th' inducement. Thus it came-give heed to't:	
	
    Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.	
	
    Then plain and right must my possession be;	
	
    Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;	
	
    Then they could smile, and fawn upon his debts,	
	
    Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!	
	
    Then we must rate the cost of the erection;	
	
    Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,	
	
    Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.	
	
    Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;	
	
    Then, for the third part of a minute, hence:	
	
    Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.	
	
    Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.	
	
    There are a kind of men so loose of soul,	
	
    There are that dare; and I myself have ventur'd	
	
    There comes the ruin, there begins confusion.           Exit	
	
    There hath at least five Frenchmen died to-night.	
	
    There is a monastery two miles off,	
	
    There is a tide in the affairs of men	
	
    There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine.	
	
    There is no certain princess that appears;	
	
    There is no sure foundation set on blood,	
	
    There is no vice so simple but assumes	
	
    There is the play-house now, there must you sit,	
	
    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,	
	
    There my Lysander and myself shall meet;	
	
    There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry;	
	
    There shouldst thou find one heinous article,	
	
    There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.	
	
    There to give up their pow'r. If you can, pace your wisdom	
	
    There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away nothing, for we	
	
    There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.	
	
    There you shall find three of your argosies	
	
    There's a letter for you.	
	
    There's hope in't yet.	
	
    There's mischief in this man. Canst thou say further?	
	
    There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,	
	
    There's not a whittle in th' unruly camp	
	
    There's some conceit or other likes him well	
	
    There's something else to do; hush, and be mute,	
	
    There, take the crown, and with the crown my curse;	
	
    Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.	
	
    Therefore I urge thy oath. For that I know	
	
    Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;	
	
    Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin,	
	
    Therefore let our proportions for these wars	
	
    Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,	
	
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,	
	
    Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,	
	
    Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.	
	
    Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his	
	
    Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so-	
	
    Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,	
	
    Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour	
	
    Therefore, your best appointment make with speed;	
	
    Thereon dependent, for your brother's life-	
	
    These are the whole contents; and, good my lord,	
	
    These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.	
	
    These eyes that see thee now well coloured	
	
    These four will change habits and present the other five.	
	
    These herblets shall which we upon you strew.	
	
    These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.	
	
    These oracles are hardly attain'd,	
	
    These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,	
	
    These thoughts of horror further than you shall	
	
    These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.	
	
    They are as children but one step below,	
	
    They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,	
	
    They are not such as you.	
	
    They be alone.	
	
    They call him Ajax.	
	
    They could not find a heart within the beast.	
	
    They eat us hungerly, and when they are full	
	
    They had such courage and audacity?	
	
    They have been violent to me and mine.	
	
    They have made themselves, and that their fitness now	
	
    They hither march amain, under conduct	
	
    They might have Ev'd to bear, and he to taste	
	
    They never then had sprung like summer flies;	
	
    They saw we had a purpose of defence.	
	
    They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.	
	
    They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,	
	
    They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,	
	
    They swell and grow as terrible as storms.	
	
    They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,	
	
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them	
	
    They would not pity me; yet plead I must,	
	
    They'll give him death by inches.	
	
    They'll tell the clock to any business that	
	
    Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like	
	
    Things of like value, differing in the owners,	
	
    Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.	
	
    Think how thou stabb'dst me in my prime of youth	
	
    Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.	
	
    Think you, but that I know our state secure,	
	
    Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- hoo!-	
	
    Thinking upon his services, took from you	
	
    This I do vow and this shall ever be,	
	
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,	
	
    This be Damascus; be thou cursed Cain,	
	
    This blended knight, half Troyan and half Greek.	
	
    This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.	
	
    This cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy,	
	
    This conduct to convey me to th' Tower.	
	
    This day is ours, as many more shall be.                Exit	
	
    This day was view'd in open as his queen,	
	
    This deity in my bosom; twenty consciences	
	
    This ensign here of mine was turning back;	
	
    This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!	
	
    This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;	
	
    This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,	
	
    This happy breed of men, this little world,	
	
    This hateful imperfection of her eyes.	
	
    This is a devil, and no monster; I will leave him; I	
	
    This is a scurvy tune too; but here's my comfort.	
	
    This is an accident of hourly proof,	
	
    This is no mortal business, nor no sound	
	
    This is some token from a newer friend.	
	
    This is the English, not the Turkish court;	
	
    This is the day which in King Edward's time	
	
    This is the pearl that pleas'd your Empress' eye;	
	
    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.	
	
    This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,	
	
    This letter he early bid me give his father,	
	
    This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show	
	
    This man may help me to his Majesty's ear,	
	
    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;	
	
    This morning for ten thousand of your throats	
	
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,	
	
    This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,	
	
    This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,	
	
    This paper thus seal'd up, and I am sure	
	
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,	
	
    This proffer'd benefit of dignity;	
	
    This rock and these demesnes have been my world,	
	
    This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,	
	
    This sickly land might solace as before.	
	
    This sleep is sound indeed; this is a sleep	
	
    This star of England. Fortune made his sword;	
	
    This tale of Heme the Hunter for a truth.	
	
    This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings	
	
    This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar's ambition-	
	
    This valley fits the purpose passing well.	
	
    This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;	
	
    This was not she. O madness of discourse,	
	
    This were to be new made when thou art old,	
	
    This wine for Lepidus!	
	
    This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou,	
	
    Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.	
	
    Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,	
	
    Those prisoners in your Highness' name demanded	
	
    Those that with haste will make a mighty fire	
	
    Those uncles which you want were dangerous;	
	
    Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.	
	
    Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich.	
	
    Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather;	
	
    Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;	
	
    Thou art straightway with the fiends.	
	
    Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak,	
	
    Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,	
	
    Thou cam'st here to complain.	
	
    Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.	
	
    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on	
	
    Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st,	
	
    Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;	
	
    Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou-	
	
    Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold	
	
    Thou has a grim appearance, and thy face	
	
    Thou hast a lady far more beautiful	
	
    Thou hast made me now a man; never before	
	
    Thou hast not done before.	
	
    Thou hast robb'd me of this deed. I would revenges,	
	
    Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,	
	
    Thou know'st not me.	
	
    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper	
	
    Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge.	
	
    Thou mightst be freed?	
	
    Thou must restore.	
	
    Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:	
	
    Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero	
	
    Thou seest what's past; go fear thy king withal.	
	
    Thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him,	
	
    Thou shalt be so well master'd; but, be sure,	
	
    Thou shalt not die whiles	
	
    Thou show'st a noble vessel. What's thy name?	
	
    Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what	
	
    Thou that contrived'st to murder our dead lord;	
	
    Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom	
	
    Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.	
	
    Thou with an eagle art inspired then.	
	
    Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not	
	
    Thou'st made me cuckold.	
	
    Though Bassianus be the Emperor's brother,	
	
    Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him	
	
    Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults	
	
    Though all the world should crack their duty to you,	
	
    Though enemy, lost aim and could not?	
	
    Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;	
	
    Though his right arm might purchase his own time,	
	
    Though in your state of honor I am perfect.	
	
    Though my revenges were high bent upon him	
	
    Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,	
	
    Though so denied fair harbour in my house.	
	
    Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!	
	
    Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures	
	
    Though you change your place you need not change your trade; I'll	
	
    Though, I confess, much like the character;	
	
    Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?	
	
    Three months this youth hath tended upon me-	
	
    Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,	
	
    Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,	
	
    Throng to the bar, crying all 'Guilty! guilty!'	
	
    Through ranks of Greekish youth; and I have seen thee,	
	
    Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.	
	
    Throw up thine eye! See, see what show'rs arise,	
	
    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:	
	
    Thus are poor servitors,	
	
    Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,	
	
    Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.	
	
    Thus ornament is but the guiled shore	
	
    Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,	
	
    Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:	
	
    Thus would I wear them out.	
	
    Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed.	
	
    Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.	
	
    Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs. And thy hair,	
	
    Thy dearest quit thee.                                  Exit	
	
    Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.       [Stabs him]	
	
    Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy,	
	
    Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.	
	
    Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell.	
	
    Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell,	
	
    Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I'll have more lives	
	
    Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.	
	
    Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.	
	
    Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,	
	
    Thy name is Gualtier, being rightly sounded.	
	
    Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die.	
	
    Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;	
	
    Thy shape invisible retain thou still.	
	
    Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go	
	
    Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood	
	
    Thy topless deputation he puts on;	
	
    Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,	
	
    Thyself domestic officers- thine enemy.	
	
    Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.	
	
    Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane	
	
    Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love	
	
    Till I have set a glory to this hand	
	
    Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign.	
	
    Till candles and star-light and moonshine be out.	
	
    Till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine	
	
    Till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire	
	
    Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn	
	
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!	
	
    Till she had kindled France and all the world	
	
    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?	
	
    Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down	
	
    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.	
	
    Till thou have audience.	
	
    Till we assign you to your days of trial	
	
    Till you did make him misinterpret me-	
	
    Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,	
	
    Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.	
	
    Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,

    To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,	
	
    To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf	
	
    To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,	
	
    To allay with some cold drops of modesty	
	
    To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,	
	
    To answer such a question. Stand again.	
	
    To any shape of thy preferment, such	
	
    To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.               Exit	
	
    To bar your Highness claiming from the female;	
	
    To be High Steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,	
	
    To be again displac'd; which to avoid,	
	
    To be commenc'd in stronds afar remote.	
	
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,	
	
    To be in anger is impiety;	
	
    To be new varnish'd! Well, but to my choice.	
	
    To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband.	
	
    To be spoke to but by the Recorder.	
	
    To be the post, in hope of his reward.

    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath	
	
    To brave the Tribune in his brother's hearing.	
	
    To break it with a fearful dream of him,	
	
    To bring him to the haven; left these notes	
	
    To build a grief on. Were you not restor'd	
	
    To burn the lodging where you use to lie,	
	
    To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.	
	
    To call upon him; he hopes it is no other	
	
    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!	
	
    To changes two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.	
	
    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;	
	
    To come abroad with him at his request.	
	
    To come at traitors' calls, and do them grace.	
	
    To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?

    To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction.	
	
    To do I know not what; but it sufficeth	
	
    To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass	
	
    To do myself this reason and this right.	
	
    To do worse to you were fell cruelty,	
	
    To do you salutation from his master.	
	
    To draw my answer from thy articles?	
	
    To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.	
	
    To emblaze the honour that thy master got.	
	
    To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;	
	
    To entertain great England's lawful king.	
	
    To every new protester, if you know	
	
    To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!                Exit	
	
    To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.	
	
    To feast with me and see me at my tent.	
	
    To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.	
	
    To fierce and bloody inclination.

    To free King Henry from imprisonment,	
	
    To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out	
	
    To gain the timely inn, and near approaches	
	
    To give each naked curtle-axe a stain	
	
    To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand

    To grace this latter age with noble deeds.	
	
    To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night.	
	
    To grow there, and to bear- 'Let me not live'-	
	
    To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.	
	
    To have free speech with you; and it concerns me	
	
    To have his pomp, and all what state compounds,	
	
    To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.	
	
    To have them in safe stowage. May it please you	
	
    To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.	
	
    To hear from me you had left Antony,	
	
    To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,	
	
    To heaven.	
	
    To help him to his grave immediately!	
	
    To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot	
	
    To hide us from pursuit that will be made

    To hinder our beginnings; we doubt not now	
	
    To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,	
	
    To hold your slaught'ring hands and keep the peace.	
	
    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;	
	
    To imitate the graces of the gods,	
	
    To join your hearts in love and amity.	
	
    To keep by policy what Henry got?	
	
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time	
	
    To kill their gracious father? Damned fact!	
	
    To kindle cowards and to steel with valor	
	
    To know the reason of these arms in peace;	
	
    To land his legions all as soon as I;	
	
    To lay our service freely at your feet,	
	
    To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax	
	
    To leave that latest which concerns him first,	
	
    To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?	
	
    To lie in watch there, and to think on him?	
	
    To line his enterprise; but if you go-	
	
    To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,	
	
    To lose't or give't away were such perdition	
	
    To love her for her mother's sake, that lov'd him,	
	
    To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;	
	
    To make bad good and good provoke to harm.	
	
    To make divorce of their incorporate league;	
	
    To make itself in thee fair and admir'd.	
	
    To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so	
	
    To make that only true we now intend,	
	
    To make them instruments of fear and warning	
	
    To make this shameless callet know herself.	
	
    To make your house our Tow'r. You a brother of us,	
	
    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.	
	
    To me, and to the state of my great grief,	
	
    To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.	
	
    To mine own children in good bringing-up;	
	
    To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle	
	
    To murther, murther our solemnity?	
	
    To my inheritance of free descent.	
	
    To new-store France with bastard warriors.	
	
    To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb	
	
    To one not sociable. I am not very sick,	
	
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.	
	
    To overbulk us all.	
	
    To pardon him that hath from nature stol'n	
	
    To pay that duty which you truly owe	
	
    To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice	
	
    To please his grandam, never trust me more.	
	
    To pluck down justice from your awful bench,	
	
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black	
	
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only	
	
    To pry into the secrets of the state;	
	
    To punish me with this, and this with me,	
	
    To put a strange face on his own perfection.	
	
    To rain a shower of commanded tears,	
	
    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle	
	
    To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,	
	
    To reinforcement, or we perish all.	
	
    To rid us from the fear we have of him.	
	
    To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;	
	
    To save unscratch'd your city's threat'ned cheeks-	
	
    To save your brother from the sacrifice;	
	
    To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,	
	
    To scorn at our solemnity this night.	
	
    To second all his plot. I do assure you	
	
    To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!	
	
    To see now how a jest shall come about!	
	
    To see these Grecian lords!-why, even already	
	
    To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop	
	
    To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;	
	
    To seek the light of truth; while truth the while	
	
    To send me packing with an host of men.	
	
    To set against me for your merriment.	
	
    To shame the guise o' th' world, I will begin	
	
    To share with me in glory any more.	
	
    To show how quaint an orator you are.	
	
    To show us so much gentry and good will	
	
    To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,	
	
    To slay the innocent? What is my offence?	
	
    To smother up the English in our throngs,	
	
    To solemnize this day the glorious sun	
	
    To sour your happiness I must report	
	
    To speak my mind, and I will through and through	
	
    To spend upon his haters. If thou please	
	
    To stand on either part.	
	
    To stay the judgment o' th' divorce; for if	
	
    To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.	
	
    To stormy passion, must perforce decay.	
	
    To study fashions to adorn my body.	
	
    To such as may the passive drugs of it	
	
    To suffer with a quietness of spirit	
	
    To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride	
	
    To take her with him to the Isle of Man.	
	
    To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we	
	
    To tear the Garter from thy craven's leg,  [Plucking it off]	
	
    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;	
	
    To tell this tale of mine.	
	
    To th' dulling of my spirits; sit down and rest.	
	
    To th' ground, and all the world shall mourn her.	
	
    To th' winds, whose pity, sighing back again,	
	
    To that I call!  [To LAVINIA]  What, would'st thou kneel with me?	
	
    To the Prince and his book-mates.	
	
    To the disposing of it nought rebell'd;	
	
    To the last hour of act; and then, 'tis thought,	
	
    To the last syllable of recorded time;	
	
    To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir,	
	
    To thee it shall descend with better quiet,	
	
    To their whole being! I am rapt, and cannot cover	
	
    To these great fellows. Sound and be hang'd, sound out!	
	
    To think on this, and shall I lack the thought	
	
    To think upon the part of business which	
	
    To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,	
	
    To this same place, to this same monument.	
	
    To those that make us both- fair ladies, you;	
	
    To tie thee to my strong correction.	
	
    To trash for over-topping, new created	
	
    To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers.	
	
    To try my fortune. By this scimitar,	
	
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.	
	
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.	
	
    To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr'd, it follows	
	
    To use it like a giant.	
	
    To view th' artillery and munition;	
	
    To wake and wage a danger profitless.	
	
    To wall thee from the liberty of flight,	
	
    To wear away this long age of three hours	
	
    To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,	
	
    To welcome him! Much more, and much more cause,	
	
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.	
	
    To whom I am subdu'd, are but light to me,	
	
    To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?	
	
    To whom you are but as a form in wax,	
	
    To win a vulgar station; our veil'd dames	
	
    To wind about my love with circumstance;	
	
    To wish me wed to one half lunatic,	
	
    To wrathful terms. This place is dangerous;	
	
    To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,	
	
    To you that chok'd it. Let be call'd before us	
	
    To young Octavius of the state of things.	
	
    To your proceedings; yet, believe me, Prince,	
	
    To-day shalt thou behold a subject die	
	
    To-morrow morning to the Council board	
	
    To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.	
	
    To-night all friends.	
	
    Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,	
	
    Together with the terror of the place-	
	
    Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow	
	
    Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze	
	
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.	
	
    Too much the rein; the strongest oaths are straw	
	
    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.	
	
    Took stand for idle speculation-	
	
    Touching our person seek we no revenge;	
	
    Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly	
	
    Towards fronting peril and oppos'd decay!	
	
    Towards which advance the war.	
	
    Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,	
	
    Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink.	
	
    Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,	
	
    Trim sport for them which had the doing of it.	
	
    Troilus-	
	
    Troubles the silver spring where England drinks;	
	
    Trudge, plod away i' th' hoof; seek shelter, pack!	
	
    Trust me, I take him for the better dog.	
	
    Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,	
	
    Turn terror into sport; as weeds before	
	
    Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.	
	
    Turns insurrection to religion.	
	
    Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.           Exit	
	
    Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed-	
	
    Two lovely berries moulded on one stern;	
	
    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,	
	
    Tying him to aught. So, putting him to rage,	
	
    Unarm thee, go; and doubt thou not, brave boy,	
	
    Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.	
	
    Uncouple here, and let us make a bay,	
	
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;	
	
    Under the colour of his usual game,	
	
    Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else	
	
    Under the wings of our Protector's grace,	
	
    Under this plot. She dies for't. Eros, ho!              Exit	
	
    Under your hands and seals; therefore, go on,	
	
    Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,	
	
    Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?	
	
    Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,	
	
    Unless by using means I lame the foot	
	
    Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,	
	
    Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;	
	
    Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;	
	
    Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art.	
	
    Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer	
	
    Unloading of his mules.	
	
    Unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have	
	
    Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'	
	
    Unstaid and skittish in all motions else	
	
    Until his ink were temp'red with Love's sighs;	
	
    Until they hear the order of his death.	
	
    Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.	
	
    Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She's wedded;	
	
    Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,	
	
    Unto the body of a dismal yew,	
	
    Unto the legions on the other side.             Loud alarum.	
	
    Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks	
	
    Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;	
	
    Unworthy brother and unworthy sons!	
	
    Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire	
	
    Upon a dwarfish thief.	
	
    Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women	
	
    Upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day	
	
    Upon entreaty have a present alms;	
	
    Upon his death unto the gentleman	
	
    Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,	
	
    Upon mine honour, for a silken point	
	
    Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms	
	
    Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,	
	
    Upon our honours?	
	
    Upon supposed fairness often known	
	
    Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent	
	
    Upon the country where you make abode;	
	
    Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,	
	
    Upon the left hand of the even field.	
	
    Upon the pashed corses of the kings	
	
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,	
	
    Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content;	
	
    Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true,	
	
    Upon this land a thousand blessings,	
	
    Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,	
	
    Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed	
	
    Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.	
	
    Us'd intercession to obtain a league,	
	
    Use our commission in his utmost force.	
	
    VENTIDIUS, one of Timon's false friends	
	
    Valuing of her--why, she, O, she is fall'n	
	
    Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for	
	
    Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;	
	
    Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,	
	
    Voic'd so regardfully?	
	
    Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,	
	
    Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!	
	
    Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse	
	
    Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,	
	
    Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Calais;	
	
    Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.	
	
    Was I a child to fear I know not what.	
	
    Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,	
	
    Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour	
	
    Was either pitied in him or forgotten.	
	
    Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body	
	
    Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?	
	
    Was it not she and that good man of worship,	
	
    Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,	
	
    Was never yet for sleep.	
	
    Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,	
	
    Was sulpherous to smell; the holy eagle	
	
    Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.	
	
    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;	
	
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,	
	
    Water with berries in't, and teach me how	
	
    We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.	
	
    We are but warriors for the working-day;	
	
    We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.	
	
    We are too well acquainted with these answers;	
	
    We breath'd our counsel; but it pleas'd your Highness	
	
    We carry not a heart with us from hence	
	
    We come within our awful banks again,	
	
    We do no otherwise than we are will'd.	
	
    We four indeed confronted were with four	
	
    We had not been thus shamefully surpris'd.	
	
    We have been too slight in sufferance.      Exit a MESSENGER	
	
    We have had pelting wars since you refus'd	
	
    We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe	
	
    We here discharge your Grace from being Regent	
	
    We let the people know't.	
	
    We made each other but so late ago.	
	
    We met him thitherward; for thence we came,	
	
    We mourn: France smiles. We lose: they daily get-	
	
    We must prepare to meet with Caliban.	
	
    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;	
	
    We please them not by land.	
	
    We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,	
	
    We shall be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck,	
	
    We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.	
	
    We should be woo'd, and were not made to woo.	
	
    We should take root here where we sit, or sit	
	
    We term it 'mulier'; which 'mulier' I divine	
	
    We twain will go into his Highness' tent.	
	
    We were to question farther; but I now	
	
    We will entice the Duke of Burgundy	
	
    We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.	
	
    We will, fair Queen, up to the mountain's top,	
	
    We would not die in that man's company	
	
    We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.	
	
    We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,	
	
    We'll lay before this town our royal bones,	
	
    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.	
	
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-	
	
    We'll see these things effected to the full.	
	
    We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,	
	
    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd	
	
    Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,	
	
    Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.	
	
    Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness	
	
    Weigh'd between loathness and obedience at	
	
    Welcome, father.	
	
    Welcome, my good friends.	
	
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure	
	
    Well worthy the best heir o' th' world, should not	
	
    Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, and groan:	
	
    Well, gaoler, on; pray God Bassanio come	
	
    Well, so its stands; and thus, I fear, at last	
	
    Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,	
	
    Were I alone to pass the difficulties,	
	
    Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,	
	
    Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings.	
	
    Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,	
	
    Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,	
	
    Were it all yours to give it in a breath,	
	
    Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe;	
	
    Were most impertinent.	
	
    Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset	
	
    Were slily crept into his human powers,	
	
    Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue	
	
    Were thine without offense; and at my death	
	
    Were't not all one an empty eagle were set	
	
    Were't not that by great preservation	
	
    What Antony shall speak, I will protest	
	
    What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,	
	
    What I have said to you.	
	
    What an ass it is! Then thou dwell'st with daws too?	
	
    What are thy rents? What are thy comings-in?	
	
    What bloody business ever.                             They rise.	
	
    What cannot be amended.	
	
    What counsel give you in this weighty cause?	
	
    What crows have peck'd them here. He brags his service,	
	
    What does this mean, my lord?	
	
    What doth befall you here. So, fare you well.	
	
    What error leads must err; O, then conclude,	
	
    What good condition can a treaty find	
	
    What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?	
	
    What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?	
	
    What he might be: if what he might he is not,	
	
    What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge	
	
    What is betid to Cloten, but remain	
	
    What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,	
	
    What is she but a foul contending rebel	
	
    What is the remedy?	
	
    What is thy sentence, then, but speechless death,	
	
    What is't to me when you yourselves are cause,	
	
    What kind of my obedience I should tender;	
	
    What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?	
	
    What may be wrought out of their discontent,	
	
    What monsters her accuse? Leonatus!	
	
    What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.	
	
    What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?	
	
    What other pleasure can the world afford?	
	
    What place? What time? What form? What likelihood?	
	
    What said my man when my betossed soul	
	
    What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?	
	
    What says the married woman? You may go.	
	
    What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?	
	
    What shall become of me?	
	
    What should I don this robe and trouble you?	
	
    What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens?	
	
    What they are us'd to bear.	
	
    What thou deniest to men; let prisons swallow 'em,	
	
    What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!	
	
    What time we will our celebration keep	
	
    What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,	
	
    What we two nights have seen.	
	
    What will ensue hereof there's none can tell;	
	
    What with the sickness of Northumberland,	
	
    What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?	
	
    What you commanded me, but by her woman	
	
    What you will have it nam'd, even that it is,	
	
    What! wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,	
	
    What's here?  [Reads]  'I have, upon especial cause,	
	
    What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks	
	
    What's this? Mutton?	
	
    What, all my pretty chickens and their dam	
	
    What, did he marry me to famish me?	
	
    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!	
	
    What, is it a time to jest and dally now?	
	
    What, madam, are you there? The King and commonweal	
	
    What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men?	
	
    What, up and down, carv'd like an appletart?	
	
    What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian	
	
    Whate'er you be, I am obedient.	
	
    When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,	
	
    When I am absent, then lie with my wife.	
	
    When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;	
	
    When I do name him, let it be thy part	
	
    When I have envied thy behaviour.	
	
    When I have spoke of you dispraisingly	
	
    When I shall turn the business of my soul	
	
    When I was got, Sir Robert was away!	
	
    When I was young, as yet I am not old,	
	
    When Talbot hath set footing once in France,	
	
    When all the world is here to look on me?	
	
    When back again this ring shall be deliver'd.	
	
    When corn was given them gratis, you repin'd;	
	
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,	
	
    When evils are most free? O, then, by day	
	
    When gold and silver becks me to come on.	
	
    When haply he shall hear that she is gone	
	
    When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,	
	
    When he sees me go back one foot or flee.             Exeunt	
	
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.	
	
    When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear	
	
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever	
	
    When it prov'd otherwise.?	
	
    When least in company. Prosper well in this,	
	
    When my good stars, that were my former guides,	
	
    When neither is attended; and I think	
	
    When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,	
	
    When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness	
	
    When shall we hear from him?	
	
    When she exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I,	
	
    When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!	
	
    When that I say the city-woman bears	
	
    When that the wat'ry palate tastes indeed	
	
    When the false Troyan under sail was seen,	
	
    When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.	
	
    When they do homage to this simple peasant.	
	
    When thou com'st thither-  [To CATESBY]  Dull,	
	
    When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.	
	
    When through proud London he came sighing on	
	
    When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,	
	
    When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,	
	
    When we banish'd him we respected not them; and, he returning to	
	
    When we were so indeed.	
	
    When you and I met at Saint Albans last	
	
    When you curse them as enemies.	
	
    When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,	
	
    When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will;	
	
    When't pleas'd you to employ me.	
	
    When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,	
	
    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,	
	
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed	
	
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,	
	
    Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.	
	
    Where and what time your Majesty shall please.	
	
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,	
	
    Where bloody murder or detested rape	
	
    Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt-	
	
    Where feed'st thou a days, Apemantus?	
	
    Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?	
	
    Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;	
	
    Where honourable rescue and defence	
	
    Where is Lucentio?	
	
    Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd	
	
    Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;	
	
    Where is the number of our English dead?	
	
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,	
	
    Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung	
	
    Where ne'er from France arriv'd more happy men.       Exeunt	
	
    Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.	
	
    Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.	
	
    Where rather I'll expect victorious life	
	
    Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;	
	
    Where small experience grows. But in a few,	
	
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,	
	
    Where there is beauty; truth where semblance; love	
	
    Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.	
	
    Where we have liv'd, and so extort from's that	
	
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough	
	
    Where's Dolabella, to second Proculeius?	
	
    Where't should be branded, if that right were right,	
	
    Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed	
	
    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore	
	
    Wherefore my father should revengers want,	
	
    Wherein I seem unnatural; desire not	
	
    Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,	
	
    Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.	
	
    Wherein we play in.	
	
    Wherein you dress'd yourself? Hath it slept since?	
	
    Whereof take you one quarter into France,	
	
    Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,	
	
    Whereon to practise your severity.	
	
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;	
	
    Wherewith already France is overrun.	
	
    Whether for east or west. The dearth is great;	
	
    Whether the tyranny be in his place,	
	
    Which God defend a knight should violate!-	
	
    Which I denying, they fell sick and died-	
	
    Which I gave him for cordial, she is serv'd	
	
    Which I have here recover'd from the Moor.	
	
    Which I have wond'red at. In hope it shall not,	
	
    Which I with more than with a common pain	
	
    Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house,	
	
    Which aptly sings the good.	
	
    Which at more leisure I will so excuse	
	
    Which bleeds away even as a form of wax	
	
    Which by the right and virtue of my place	
	
    Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,	
	
    Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,	
	
    Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time	
	
    Which else should free have wrought.	
	
    Which falls into mine ears as profitless	
	
    Which for things true weeps things imaginary.	
	
    Which from the vineyard to the garden leads.	
	
    Which had superfluous kings for messengers	
	
    Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by th' wall	
	
    Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.	
	
    Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder	
	
    Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls	
	
    Which holds not colour with the time, nor does	
	
    Which in the day of battle tire thee more	
	
    Which is as bad as die with tickling.	
	
    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit	
	
    Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish	
	
    Which is the side that I must go withal?	
	
    Which is- no, no- which was the fairest dame	
	
    Which makes him prune himself and bristle up	
	
    Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd	
	
    Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,	
	
    Which my most inward true and duteous spirit	
	
    Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,	
	
    Which not to read would show the Britons cold;	
	
    Which now's upon 's; without the which this story	
	
    Which often, since my here-remain in England,	
	
    Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner	
	
    Which parti-coated presence of loose love	
	
    Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.	
	
    Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;	
	
    Which should not find a ground to root upon	
	
    Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.	
	
    Which sometime hath his hour with every man.	
	
    Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent	
	
    Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.          Exit.	
	
    Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.	
	
    Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,	
	
    Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains;	
	
    Which time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be-	
	
    Which to this hour bewail the injury,	
	
    Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,	
	
    Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely	
	
    Which we have not done neither; that, I fear,	
	
    Which we in justice cannot well deny,	
	
    Which well appeared in his lineaments,	
	
    Which will require your answer, you must take	
	
    Which would be planted newly with the time,	
	
    Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?	
	
    Which you might from relation likewise reap,	
	
    Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers	
	
    Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.	
	
    Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now	
	
    Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her	
	
    Which, on your just proceeding, I'll keep off-	
	
    Which, though I will not practise to deceive,	
	
    Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it.	
	
    While I stand by and weep to hear him speak.	
	
    While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.	
	
    While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,	
	
    While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,	
	
    While we bethink a means to break it off.	
	
    Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,	
	
    Whiles that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold	
	
    Whiles thou art waking.	
	
    Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge	
	
    Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.	
	
    Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,	
	
    Whilst you abide here.	
	
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'	
	
    Whither I go, nor reason whereabout.	
	
    Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.	
	
    Who are the late commissioners?	
	
    Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his	
	
    Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore	
	
    Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends	
	
    Who comes here?	
	
    Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!	
	
    Who for this seven years hath esteemed him	
	
    Who had been hither sent on the debating	
	
    Who hath abandoned her holy groves	
	
    Who having into truth, by telling of it,	
	
    Who in that sale sells pardon from himself-	
	
    Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,	
	
    Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.	
	
    Who lately came from the King, commands the contrary.	
	
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;	
	
    Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March;	
	
    Who never promiseth but he means to pay.	
	
    Who prays continually for Richmond's good.	
	
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,	
	
    Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury	
	
    Who strongly hath set footing in this land.	
	
    Who though they cannot answer my distress,	
	
    Who told me, in the narrow seas that part	
	
    Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,	
	
    Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.	
	
    Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,	
	
    Who's here? Speak, ho! No answer? What is this?	
	
    Who's within there, ho?	
	
    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,	
	
    Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves	
	
    Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,	
	
    Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,	
	
    Whoever knocks!	
	
    Whom I myself embrace to set him free.'	
	
    Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;	
	
    Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh,	
	
    Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight,	
	
    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world	
	
    Whom we have left protectors of the King,	
	
    Whom worthily you would have now succeed,	
	
    Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,	
	
    Whose better issue in the war from Italy	
	
    Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,	
	
    Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;	
	
    Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch	
	
    Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted	
	
    Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,	
	
    Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.	
	
    Whose height commands as subject all the vale,	
	
    Whose hot incursions and great name in arms	
	
    Whose influence is begot of that loose grace	
	
    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows	
	
    Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers,	
	
    Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,	
	
    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege	
	
    Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,	
	
    Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!	
	
    Whose vows are that no bed-rite shall be paid	
	
    Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,	
	
    Why I should yield to thee.	
	
    Why are we met in council?	
	
    Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me	
	
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?	
	
    Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?	
	
    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'	
	
    Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;	
	
    Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,	
	
    Why seems it so particular with thee?	
	
    Why should I write this down that's riveted,	
	
    Why sinks that cauldron, and what noise is this?	
	
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task	
	
    Why then, fly on; I'll hunt thee for thy hide.             Exeunt	
	
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,	
	
    Why you are heavy and what men tonight	
	
    Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,	
	
    Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind,	
	
    Why, let the war receive't in valiant gore;	
	
    Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?	
	
    Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength,	
	
    Why, thou silly gentleman!	
	
    Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?	
	
    Will I for ever, and my faction, wear,	
	
    Will I with wine and wassail so convince	
	
    Will bless the King-and is not this course pious?	
	
    Will bring this labour to an happy end.                    Exeunt	
	
    Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.	
	
    Will drive away distemper. To some shade,	
	
    Will give him cable.	
	
    Will he be satisfied.	
	
    Will knit and break religions, bless th' accurs'd,	
	
    Will make or man or woman madly dote	
	
    Will make what's homely savoury; weariness	
	
    Will not debate the question of this straw.	
	
    Will not your honours bear me company?	
	
    Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.	
	
    Will quench the wonder of her infamy.	
	
    Will see his burial better than his life.	
	
    Will she not forth?	
	
    Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?	
	
    Will tie you to the numbers and the time	
	
    Will we take throughly.	
	
    Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?	
	
    Will you lead, lords?	
	
    Willing you overlook this pedigree.	
	
    Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?	
	
    Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for	
	
    Wincot, if she know me not; if she say I am not fourteen pence on	
	
    Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up;	
	
    Wish him ten fathom deep: this Duke as much	
	
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,	
	
    With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch of Eie,	
	
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,	
	
    With a refined traveller of Spain,	
	
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;	
	
    With all my imperfections on my head.	
	
    With all th' applause-and clamour of the host,	
	
    With all these living in philosophy.	
	
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,	
	
    With any just reproach?	
	
    With aptness of the season; make denials	
	
    With bloody passage led your wars even to	
	
    With brazen din blast you the city's ear;	
	
    With charitable bill- O bill, sore shaming	
	
    With contemplation and devout desires.	
	
    With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,	
	
    With drunken spilth of wine, when every room	
	
    With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,	
	
    With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer	
	
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!	
	
    With full accord to all our just demands;	
	
    With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales	
	
    With half their forces the full pride of France,	
	
    With haughty arms this hateful name in us.	
	
    With him along is come the mother-queen,

    You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.	
	
    You are the King's now.	
	
    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.	
	
    You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!	
	
    You bid me seek redemption of the devil!	
	
    You break not sanctuary in seizing him.	
	
    You cannot reason almost with a man	
	
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane	
	
    You did supplant your brother Prospero.	
	
    You do remember all the circumstance?	
	
    You fools of fortune, trencher friends, time's flies,	
	
    You gave me this; but take it, sir, again.	
	
    You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with thankfulness.	
	
    You have Christian warrant for 'em, and no doubt	
	
    You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me	
	
    You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,	
	
    You have no children, butchers, if you had,	
	
    You have, enschedul'd briefly, in your hands.	
	
    You knew my father well, and in him me,	
	
    You know an enemy intends you harm;	
	
    You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,	
	
    You leer upon me, do you? There's an eye	
	
    You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.	
	
    You master's mistress.	
	
    You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,	
	
    You may then spare that time.	
	
    You must be godfather, and answer for her.	
	
    You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con

    You take much pains to mend.	
	
    You taught me first to beg, and now, methinks,	
	
    You that are blam'd for it alike with us,	
	
    You thus employ'd, I will go root away	
	
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?	
	
    You use in abject and in slavish parts,	
	
    You were best meddle with buck-washing.	
	
    You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?    [Strikes him]	
	
    You will say she did embrace me as a husband,	
	
    You would have slipp'd like him; but he, like you,	
	
    You'd feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,	
	
    You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him.	
	
    You'll speak with Coriolanus.	
	
    You, sir, what trade are you?

    Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower,	
	
    Your King and Warwick's and must have my will.	
	
    Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?	
	
    Your breath with full consent benied his sails;	
	
    Your brother's son shall never reign our king;	
	
    Your children were vexation to your youth;	
	
    Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,	
	
    Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;	
	
    Your father's heir must have your father's land.	
	
    Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.	
	
    Your greeting is from him, not from the King.	
	
    Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;	
	
    Your husband, he is gone to save far off,	
	
    Your importunacy cease till after dinner,	
	
    Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.	
	
    Your lord sends now for money.

    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.	
	
    Your uncle must not know but you are dead:	
	
    Your well-defended honour, you must pardon

  And the great care of goods at random left,	
	
  And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.	
	
  And this is false you burden me withal.	
	
  And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,	
	
  And under thee their poesy disperse.	
	
  And whether that my angel be turned fiend,	
	
  And with you take the chain, and bid my wife

  And your sweet semblance to some other give.

  BEROWNE. Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.	
	
  BERTRAM. A plague upon him! muffled! He can say nothing of me.	
	
  BERTRAM. And I will do so.	
	
  BERTRAM. He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme in's	
	
  BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.	
	
  BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik'd her,	
	
  BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,	
	
  BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign,	
	
  BERTRAM. She's impudent, my lord,	
	
  BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be	
	
  BERTRAM. Well, what would you say?	
	
  BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord;	
	
  BIANCA. 'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.            Exeunt.	
	
  BIANCA. Believe me, sister, of all the men alive	
	
  BIANCA. Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.	
	
  BIANCA. Save you, friend Cassio!	
	
  BIGOT. Who kill'd this prince?	
	
  BIONDELLO	
	
  BIONDELLO. I told him that your father was at Venice,	
	
  BIONDELLO. Sir, my mistress sends you word	
	
  BIONDELLO. You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?	
	
  BLANCH. Now shall I see thy love. What motive may

  BOATSWAIN. Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!	
	
  BOATSWAIN. What, must our mouths be cold?	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. I shall not need transport my words by you;	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. On Wednesday next we solemnly set down	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. These differences shall all rest under gage	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Yet ask.	
	
  BOTH MURDERERS. Ay, ay.	
	
  BOTH.      All lovers young, all lovers must	
	
  BOTH. What, what, what? Let's partake.	
	
  BOTTOM. Are we all met?	
	
  BOTTOM. I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have the tongs	
	
  BOTTOM. If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.	
	
  BOTTOM. Not so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this	
	
  BOTTOM. Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber	
	
  BOTTOM. [Starting up] No, I assure you; the wall is down that

  BOYET. A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.	
	
  BOYET. But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd;	
	
  BOYET. Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty	
	
  BOYET. I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.          Exit	
	
  BOYET. Prepare, madam, prepare!	
	
  BOYET. Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.	
	
  BOYET. True; out indeed.

  BRABANTIO.               But thou must needs be sure	
	
  BRABANTIO. Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!	
	
  BRABANTIO. O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?	
	
  BRAKENBURY. I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:	
	
  BRAKENBURY. What, so brief?	
	
  BRUTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.	
	
  BRUTUS. And when such time they have begun to cry,	
	
  BRUTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these?	
	
  BRUTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,	
	
  BRUTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.	
	
  BRUTUS. Do so, and let no man abide this deed	
	
  BRUTUS. Everything is well.	
	
  BRUTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.	
	
  BRUTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.	
	
  BRUTUS. He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,	
	
  BRUTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.	
	
  BRUTUS. I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,	
	
  BRUTUS. In this point charge him home, that he affects	
	
  BRUTUS. Lay	
	
  BRUTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.	
	
  BRUTUS. Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man	
	
  BRUTUS. Not I.	
	
  BRUTUS. Not to them all.	
	
  BRUTUS. Or else were this a savage spectacle.	
	
  BRUTUS. Peace, count the clock.	
	
  BRUTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:	
	
  BRUTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,	
	
  BRUTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;	
	
  BRUTUS. They stand, and would have parley.	
	
  BRUTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?	
	
  BRUTUS. What, Lucius, ho!	
	
  BRUTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.	
	
  BRUTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!	
	
  BUCKINGHAM.  [Aside]  And supper too, although thou	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee.	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Hastings, and Edward's children, Grey, and	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. I hear the news, my lord.	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord-	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. No, not a syllable:	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Or thou or I, Somerset, will be Protector,	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Sorry I am my noble cousin should	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong

  BUCKINGHAM. Which since you come too late of our intent,	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin'd he should die	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. York, if thou meanest well I greet thee well.	
	
  BURGUNDY. As love is, my lord, before it loves.	
	
  BURGUNDY. Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you for	
	
  BUSHY - favourites of King Richard	
	
  BUSHY. Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,	
	
  BUSHY. Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland	
	
  Balth. Because you talk of wooing, I will sing,	
	
  Bard. 'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!	
	
  Bard. I Will, Captain. Farewell.                         Exit.	
	
  Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-	
	
  Be where you list, your charter is so strong,	
	
  Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;	
	
  Beat. As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for	
	
  Beat. For them all together, which maintain'd so politic a state of	
	
  Beat. I am gone, though I am here. There is no love in you. Nay, I	
	
  Beat. In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you	
	
  Beat. No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star	
	
  Beat. O, God help me! God help me! How long have you profess'd	
	
  Beat. They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.	
	
  Beat. What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make	
	
  Beat. Why, he is the Prince's jester, a very dull fool. Only his	
	
  Beat. Yea, as sure is I have a thought or a soul.	
	
  Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:	
	
  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,	
	
  Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.	
	
  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's	
	
  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.	
	
  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?	
	
  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all	
	
  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,	
	
  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,	
	
  Bene. And therefore will come.	
	
  Bene. Beat--	
	
  Bene. First, of my word! Therefore play, music. Prince, thou art	
	
  Bene. Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.'	
	
  Bene. I know that, but I would have thee hence and here again.	
	
  Bene. Is there any way to show such friendship?	
	
  Bene. Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?	
	
  Bene. Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for	
	
  Bene. Tarry, sweet Beatrice.	
	
  Bene. They swore that you were almost sick for me.	
	
  Bene. Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame, I found	
	
  Bene. Why, then your uncle, and the Prince, and Claudio	
	
  Bene. Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old signior, walk	
	
  Benvolio, nephew to Montague, and friend to Romeo	
	
  Ber. See, it stalks away!	
	
  Ber. Who's there.?	
	
  Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.	
	
  Blunt. The circumstance considered, good my lord,	
	
  Bora. I came yonder from a great supper. The Prince your brother is	
	
  Bora. Mass, and my elbow itch'd! I thought there would a scab	
	
  Bora. Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is?	
	
  Borachio, follower of Don John.	
	
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.	
	
  Both. We will haste us.	
	
  Bur. Pardon me, royal sir.	
	
  But I should know her as well as she knows me.	
	
  But be contented when that fell arrest,	
	
  But do thy worst to steal thy self away,	
	
  But here's a villain that would face me down	
	
  But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.	
	
  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,	
	
  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:	
	
  But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,	
	
  But though thou art adjudged to the death,	
	
  But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes	
	
  Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;	
	
  By computation and mine host's report	
	
  By rushing in their houses, bearing thence	
	
  CADE. And Adam was a gardener.	
	
  CADE. Brave thee? Ay, by the best blood that ever was broach'd, and	
	
  CADE. By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I heard!	
	
  CADE. I have thought upon it; it shall be so. Away, burn all the	
	
  CADE. O monstrous!	
	
  CADE. To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.	
	
  CADE. Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?	
	
  CAESAR. Antonio!	
	
  CAESAR. Cleopatra, know	
	
  CAESAR. Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.	
	
  CAESAR. Good night.                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA	
	
  CAESAR. He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.	
	
  CAESAR. Let him appear that's come from Antony.	
	
  CAESAR. Mark Antony shall say I am not well,	
	
  CAESAR. Possess it, I'll make answer.	
	
  CAESAR. Shall Caesar send a lie?	
	
  CAESAR. That ever I should call thee cast-away!	
	
  CAESAR. Welcome hither.	
	
  CAESAR. Which is the Queen of Egypt?	
	
  CAESAR. You have broken	
	
  CAIUS, I come to fetch you home. I am sworn of the peace;	
	
  CAIUS. Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me; my nursh-a	
	
  CAIUS. By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.	
	
  CAIUS. Fe, fe, fe fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je m'en vais a	
	
  CAIUS. Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?	
	
  CALCHAS, a Trojan priest, taking part with the Greeks	
	
  CALIBAN, a savage and deformed slave	
	
  CALIBAN. As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd	
	
  CALIBAN. I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy	
	
  CALIBAN. I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true	
	
  CALIBAN. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,	
	
  CALIBAN. Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him	
	
  CALPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;	
	
  CAMPEIUS. Put your main cause into the King's protection;	
	
  CANIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?	
	
  CANIDIUS. With news the time's with labour and throes forth	
	
  CAPHIS. Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus.	
	
  CAPHIS. Where's the fool now?	
	
  CAPTAIN. This is Illyria, lady.	
	
  CAPTAIN. To them the legions garrison'd in Gallia,	
	
  CARDINAL BOURCHIER, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY	
	
  CARDINAL. If thou be'st Death I'll give thee England's treasure,	
	
  CARDINAL. My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.	
	
  CARLISLE. As surely as I live, my lord.	
	
  CASCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth	
	
  CASCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.	
	
  CASCA. No.	
	
  CASCA. Why, for that too.	
	
  CASSANDRA. Cry, Troyans, cry. Lend me ten thousand eyes,	
	
  CASSANDRA. O, farewell, dear Hector!	
	
  CASSIO.                      See for the news.	
	
  CASSIO. 'Tis truly so.	
	
  CASSIO. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.	
	
  CASSIO. Faith, I intend so.	
	
  CASSIO. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!	
	
  CASSIO. I'll do't, but it dislikes me.                        Exit.	
	
  CASSIO. Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.	
	
  CASSIO. Masters, play here, I will content your pains; Something	
	
  CASSIO. Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold	
	
  CASSIO. The great contention of the sea and skies	
	
  CASSIO. You advise me well.	
	
  CASSIUS, instigator of the conspiracy	
	
  CASSIUS. Antony,	
	
  CASSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?	
	
  CASSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet	
	
  CASSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;	
	
  CASSIUS. I an itching palm?	
	
  CASSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,	
	
  CASSIUS. Is it come to this?	
	
  CASSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!	
	
  CASSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?	
	
  CASSIUS. That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:	
	
  CASSIUS. Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,	
	
  CASSIUS. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life	
	
  CASSIUS. Yet I fear him,	
	
  CATESBY. Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward	
	
  CATESBY. I'll signify so much unto him straight.          Exit	
	
  CATO. Brave Titinius!	
	
  CELIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,	
	
  CELIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be	
	
  CELIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.	
	
  CELIA. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?	
	
  CELIA. I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.	
	
  CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.	
	
  CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love	
	
  CELIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection	
	
  CELIA. Thou hast not, cousin.	
	
  CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.	
	
  CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must	
	
  CENTURION. Enobarbus?	
	
  CHAMBERLAIN. Good day to both your Graces.	
	
  CHAMBERLAIN. Is't possible the spells of France should juggle	
	
  CHAMBERLAIN. My lords, you speak your pleasures.	
	
  CHAMBERLAIN. You bear a gentle mind, and heav'nly blessings	
	
  CHANCELLOR. Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,	
	
  CHARLES. Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to	
	
  CHARLES. Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd	
	
  CHARLES. On what submissive message art thou sent?	
	
  CHARLES. Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!	
	
  CHARLES. What she says I'll confirm; we'll fight it out.	
	
  CHARMIAN. Do? Why, what else?	
	
  CHARMIAN. Hush!	
	
  CHARMIAN. In this vile world? So, fare thee well.	
	
  CHARMIAN. Nay, come, tell Iras hers.	
	
  CHARMIAN. Pray, then, foresee me one.	
	
  CHARMIAN. Three in Egypt	
	
  CHATILLON. Then turn your forces from this paltry siege	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Have you your wits? Know you what 'tis you speak?	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I cannot now speak. I will hear you soon.	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, God send the Prince a better companion!	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. What is the matter? Keep the peace here, ho!	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. You speak as having power to do wrong; but answer in	
	
  CHIRON. An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.	
	
  CHIRON. Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,	
	
  CHIRON. Was never Scythia half so barbarous!	
	
  CHORUS. Thus with imagin'd wing our swift scene flies,	
	
  CINNA. As a friend.	
	
  CINNA. No, by no means.	
	
  CITIZEN. And you.	
	
  CITIZEN. Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?	
	
  CLARENCE. Alas, you know 'tis far from hence to France!	
	
  CLARENCE. By heaven, I think there is no man is secure	
	
  CLARENCE. His Majesty,	
	
  CLARENCE. Let us withdraw into the other room.	
	
  CLARENCE. O my royal father!	
	
  CLARENCE. To London, all in post; and, as I guess,	
	
  CLARENCE. To who, my lord?	
	
  CLARENCE. Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest	
	
  CLAUDIO. But is there any?	
	
  CLAUDIO. My lord?	
	
  CLAUDIO. The miserable have no other medicine	
	
  CLAUDIO. The precise Angelo!	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Ay, ay; farewell.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Guess at her years, I prithee.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. He is a god, and knows	
	
  CLEOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. I thank you, sir.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. I'll give thee, friend,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Is this certain?	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Most kind messenger,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Noblest of men, woo't die?	
	
  CLEOPATRA. O my lord, my lord,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Peace, peace!	
	
  CLEOPATRA. See where he is, who's with him, what he does.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not drink, sir;	
	
  CLEOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time	
	
  CLEOPATRA. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Was he not here?	
	
  CLEOPATRA. What, of death too,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Why, there's more gold.	
	
  CLIFFORD. Are these thy bears? We'll bait thy bears to death,	
	
  CLIFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.	
	
  CLIFFORD. How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!	
	
  CLIFFORD. My gracious liege, this too much lenity	
	
  CLIFFORD. The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.	
	
  CLIFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words	
	
  CLITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.	
	
  CLOTEN. A stranger, and I not known on't?	
	
  CLOTEN. Die the death.	
	
  CLOTEN. I'll be reveng'd.	
	
  CLOTEN. It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou wouldst	
	
  CLOTEN. Sirrah, is this letter true?	
	
  CLOTEN. To leave you in your madness 'twere my sin;	
	
  CLOTEN. Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction? Would he had been	
	
  CLOWN. 'Tis he.- God and Saint Stephen give you godden. I have	
	
  CLOWN. Are you ready, sir?	
	
  CLOWN. But as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in	
	
  CLOWN. By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my	
	
  CLOWN. Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest	
	
  CLOWN. Good Sir Toby!	
	
  CLOWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.	
	
  CLOWN. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my	
	
  CLOWN. I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a	
	
  CLOWN. Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go,	
	
  CLOWN. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.	
	
  CLOWN. No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly; she will keep	
	
  CLOWN. Now the melancholy god protect thee; and the tailor make thy	
	
  CLOWN. She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very	
	
  CLOWN. Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should	
	
  CLOWN. Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the stave's end as well	
	
  CLOWN. Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in't; and	
	
  CLOWN. Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits	
	
  CLOWN. You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a	
	
  COBWEB. Ready.	
	
  COLVILLE. I am a knight sir; and my name is Colville of the Dale.	
	
  COMINIUS. Come, come, we'll prompt you.	
	
  COMINIUS. Go we to our tent.	
	
  COMINIUS. I think 'twill serve, if he	
	
  COMINIUS. Nay, come away.	
	
  COMINIUS. Too modest are you;	
	
  COMINIUS. You have fought together?	
	
  CONSTABLE. A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were day!	
	
  CONSTABLE. I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow to	
	
  CONSTABLE. Just, just! and the men do sympathise with the mastiffs	
	
  CONSTABLE. Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.	
	
  CONSTABLE. Why, an our ranks are broke.	
	
  CONSTANCE. Gone to be married! Gone to swear a peace!	
	
  CONSTANCE. No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.	
	
  CONSTANCE. O, upon my knee,	
	
  CORIN,    shepherd	
	
  CORIN. Nay, I hope.	
	
  CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I	
	
  CORIOLANUS. A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begg'd.	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Follow your function, go and batten on cold bits.	
	
  CORIOLANUS. How? What?	
	
  CORIOLANUS. I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Is this done?	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Menenius ever, ever.	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Nay, I prithee, woman-	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Pray be content.	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Tell me of corn!	
	
  CORIOLANUS. That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!	
	
  CORIOLANUS. What do you prate of service?

  IAGO. Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.	
	
  IAGO. My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;	
	
  IAGO. My noble lord-	
	
  IAGO. O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink for you.	
	
  IAGO. She never yet was foolish that was fair,	
	
  IAGO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute	
	
  IAGO. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;	
	
  IAGO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak	
	
  IAGO. What, are you hurt, lieutenant?	
	
  IAGO. Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,	
	
  IAGO. You charge me most unjustly.	
	
  IAGO. You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.	
	
  IDEN. Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?	
	
  IMOGEN. All's well, sir; take my pow'r i' th' court for yours.	
	
  IMOGEN. He is a Roman, no more kin to me	
	
  IMOGEN. How now, Pisanio!	
	
  IMOGEN. I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven,	
	
  IMOGEN. I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please	
	
  IMOGEN. No, my lord;	
	
  IMOGEN. Richard du Champ. [Aside] If I do lie, and do	
	
  IMOGEN. Some Roman courtezan!	
	
  IMOGEN. Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.	
	
  IMOGEN. What hour is it?	
	
  IMOGEN. You do seem to know	
	
  IMOGEN. [Kneeling] Your blessing, sir.	
	
  IRAS. Madam, O good Empress!	
	
  IRAS. The gods forbid!	
	
  ISABELLA, sister to Claudio	
	
  ISABELLA. At what hour to-morrow	
	
  ISABELLA. Gentle my lord, turn back.	
	
  ISABELLA. I am directed by you.	
	
  ISABELLA. I know your virtue hath a license in't,	
	
  ISABELLA. In brief- to set the needless process by,	
	
  ISABELLA. None, but such remedy as, to save a head,	
	
  ISABELLA. O just but severe law!	
	
  ISABELLA. O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,	
	
  ISABELLA. Sir, believe this:	
	
  ISABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,	
	
  ISABELLA. True.	
	
  ISABELLA. You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.	
	
  ISABELLA. [Kneeling] Most bounteous sir,	
	
  If I might teach thee wit better it were,	
	
  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:	
	
  If it be not, then love doth well denote,	
	
  If this be not a dream I see and hear.	
	
  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,	
	
  In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,	
	
  In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,	
	
  In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,	
	
  In the distraction of this madding fever!	
	
  Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls,	
	
  Is from the book of honour razed quite,	
	
  It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,	
	
  It is thyself, mine own self's better part;	
	
  JAQUENETTA. Fair weather after you!	
	
  JAQUENETTA. Good Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter;	
	
  JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,	
	
  JAQUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.	
	
  JAQUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.	
	
  JAQUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and	
	
  JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?	
	
  JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet.	
	
  JESSICA. Farewell, good Launcelot.              Exit LAUNCELOT	
	
  JESSICA. Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed;	
	
  JEWELLER. And rich. Here is a water, look ye.	
	
  JEWELLER. You know me, Apemantus?	
	
  JOHN. And Dick the butcher-	
	
  JOHN. Yes, your renowned name; shall flight abuse it?	
	
  JULIET. I do confess it, and repent it, father.	
	
  JUSTICE. Lord Angelo is severe.	
	
  John. And when I have heard it, what blessings brings it?	
	
  John. Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in	
	
  John. I make all use of it, for I use it only.	
	
  John. Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her	
	
  John. What proof shall I make of that?	
	
  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.	
	
  Jul. Ay me!	
	
  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?	
	
  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,	
	
  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;	
	
  Jul. Madam, I am not well.	
	
  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?	
	
  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight	
	
  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,	
	
  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.	
	
  Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?	
	
  Juliet, daughter to Capulet.	
	
  KATHARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark.	
	
  KATHARINE. But, in this changing, what is your intent?	
	
  KATHARINE. I thank you, honest lord. Remember me	
	
  KATHARINE. O, my Lord,	
	
  KATHARINE. To my fortunes and me.	
	
  KATHERINA. 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.'	
	
  KATHERINA. Call you me daughter? Now I promise you	
	
  KATHERINA. I care not.	
	
  KATHERINA. I will be angry; what hast thou to do?	
	
  KATHERINA. I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;	
	
  KATHERINA. No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.	
	
  KATHERINA. Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun;	
	
  KATHERINA. Too light for such a swain as you to catch;	
	
  KATHERINA. Would Katherine had never seen him though!	
	
  KATHERINE. C'est assez pour une fois: allons-nous a diner.	
	
  KATHERINE. Et le coude?	
	
  KATHERINE. O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de	
	
  KEEPER. Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.	
	
  KEEPER. Your Grace must wait till you be call'd for.	
	
  KING EDWARD. And would you not do much to do them good?	
	
  KING EDWARD. Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans' field	
	
  KING EDWARD. Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!	
	
  KING EDWARD. Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much.	
	
  KING EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.	
	
  KING EDWARD. Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?	
	
  KING EDWARD. Once more we sit in England's royal throne,	
	
  KING EDWARD. Take heed you dally not before your king;	
	
  KING EDWARD. Well, jest on, brothers; I can tell you both	
	
  KING EDWARD. Where's Richard gone?	
	
  KING EDWARD. You'd think it strange if I should marry her.	
	
  KING HENRY THE SIXTH	
	
  KING HENRY. Ah, what a sign it is of evil life	
	
  KING HENRY. And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.	
	
  KING HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.	
	
  KING HENRY. By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King: I	
	
  KING HENRY. Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?	
	
  KING HENRY. Farewell, my Hector and my Troy's true hope.	
	
  KING HENRY. Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;	
	
  KING HENRY. Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,	
	
  KING HENRY. How fares my lord? Speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign.	
	
  KING HENRY. How now! What means this, herald? know'st thou not	
	
  KING HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,	
	
  KING HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:	
	
  KING HENRY. Iden, kneel down. [He kneels] Rise up a knight.	
	
  KING HENRY. Is't so, my lords of England?	
	
  KING HENRY. Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for	
	
  KING HENRY. My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:	
	
  KING HENRY. My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best	
	
  KING HENRY. O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?	
	
  KING HENRY. O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your	
	
  KING HENRY. Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!	
	
  KING HENRY. Shall Kate be my wife?	
	
  KING HENRY. Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;	
	
  KING HENRY. The treasury of everlasting joy!	
	
  KING HENRY. Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,	
	
  KING HENRY. This note doth tell me of ten thousand French	
	
  KING HENRY. Uncle of Winchester, I pray read on.	
	
  KING HENRY. Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne	
	
  KING HENRY. We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,	
	
  KING HENRY. What mean'st thou, Suffolk? Tell me, what are these?	
	
  KING HENRY. Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?	
	
  KING HENRY. Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves	
	
  KING HENRY. Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us;	
	
  KING JOHN. A grave.	
	
  KING JOHN. Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace;	
	
  KING JOHN. England for itself.	
	
  KING JOHN. Hubert, away with him; imprison him;	
	
  KING JOHN. If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,	
	
  KING JOHN. Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,	
	
  KING JOHN. Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.	
	
  KING JOHN. The legate of the Pope hath been with me,	
	
  KING JOHN. We from the west will send destruction	
	
  KING JOHN. Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?	
	
  KING PHILIP. A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish,	
	
  KING PHILIP. Excuse it is to beat usurping down.	
	
  KING PHILIP. Peace be to England, if that war return	
	
  KING PHILIP. Stand in his face to contradict his claim.	
	
  KING PHILIP. Women and fools, break off your conference.	
	
  KING RICHARD. A thousand hearts are great within my	
	
  KING RICHARD. Away towards Salisbury! While we reason	
	
  KING RICHARD. Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the	
	
  KING RICHARD. But didst thou see them dead?	
	
  KING RICHARD. Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so.	
	
  KING RICHARD. Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell.	
	
  KING RICHARD. Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;	
	
  KING RICHARD. I do remember me: Henry the Sixth	
	
  KING RICHARD. It boots thee not to be compassionate;	
	
  KING RICHARD. Madam, with all my heart.	
	
  KING RICHARD. My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine.	
	
  KING RICHARD. O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine	
	
  KING RICHARD. O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight	
	
  KING RICHARD. Say that again.	
	
  KING RICHARD. So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!	
	
  KING RICHARD. That would I learn of you,	
	
  KING RICHARD. Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.	
	
  KING RICHARD. Thou chid'st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come	
	
  KING RICHARD. We thank you both; yet one but flatters us,	
	
  KING RICHARD. Well, but o'clock?	
	
  KING RICHARD. Where is thy power then, to beat him back?	
	
  KING RICHARD. Who intercepts me in my expedition?	
	
  KING RICHARD. You speak too bitterly.	
	
  KING. 'Tis nobly spoken.	
	
  KING. 'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed	
	
  KING. And wherefore should these good news make me sick?	
	
  KING. As thou art a knave and no knave.	
	
  KING. Body a me, where is it?	
	
  KING. But your legs should do it.	
	
  KING. Did you hear the proclamation?	
	
  KING. Farewell, young lords; these war-like principles	
	
  KING. Good, my lord,	
	
  KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,	
	
  KING. I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.	
	
  KING. I fear, too much.	
	
  KING. If he were living, I would try him yet-	
	
  KING. Is it good morrow, lords?	
	
  KING. It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a	
	
  KING. Madam, I was.	
	
  KING. More measure of this measure; be not nice.	
	
  KING. Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it,	
	
  KING. Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.	
	
  KING. O Lord Archbishop,	
	
  KING. Praising what is lost	
	
  KING. Stand up, lord.                   [The KING kisses the child]	
	
  KING. Take her by the hand,	
	
  KING. The Prince of Wales! Where is he? Let me see him.	
	
  KING. This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,	
	
  KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.	
	
  KING. Upon mine honour, no.	
	
  KING. Well, it was proclaimed damsel.	
	
  KING. What's that, Butts?	
	
  KING. Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow?	
	
  KING. Why, how now, lords, your wrathful weapons drawn	
	
  KING. You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.	
	
  KING. [Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and sole	
	
  Kent. Alack, why thus?	
	
  Kent. Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King, and

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance	
	
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.	
	
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?	
	
  King. Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend,	
	
  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.	
	
  King. It seems then that the tidings of this broil	
	
  King. Make up to Clifton; I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.	
	
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.	
	
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.	
	
  King. Theft with the losers let it sympathize,	
	
  King. Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.	
	
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.	
	
  King. With all my heart.	
	
  Knight. I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for	
	
  LADY ANNE, widow of Edward, Prince of Wales, son to King	
	
  LADY GREY. My mind will never grant what I perceive	
	
  LADY GREY. What you command that rests in me to do.

  LADY MACBETH. Donalbain.	
	
  LADY MACBETH. Is Banquo gone from court?	
	
  LADY MACBETH. That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;

  LADY MACDUFF. Poor bird! Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,	
	
  LADY MACDUFF. Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.	
	
  LADY PERCY. O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!	
	
  LADY. Madam, we'll tell tales.	
	
  LAFEU. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand

  LAFEU. I am sure I saw her wear it.

  LAFEU. O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a	
	
  LAFEU. There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but	
	
  LAFEU. Very hand of heaven.	
	
  LAFEU. You have it from his own deliverance.	
	
  LAFEU. Your distinction?	
	
  LARTIUS. Marcius, his name?

  LAUNCELOT. For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the meat,	
	
  LAUNCELOT. I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window for

  LAUNCELOT. The old proverb is very well parted between my master	
	
  LAVINIA. I say no;	
	
  LAVINIA. No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,

  LENNOX. Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your Highness?	
	
  LENNOX. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look	
	
  LEPIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.	
	
  LEPIDUS. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are	
	
  LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar!	
	
  LEPIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.	
	
  LEWIS. Father, to arms!

  LUCENTIO. Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak!	
	
  LUCENTIO. I may and will, if she be so contented.	
	
  LUCENTIO. Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?	
	
  LUCENTIO. That will I.	
	
  LUCENTIO. While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.

  Lear. I gave you all-

  MACBETH. Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,	
	
  MACBETH. I am settled and bend up	
	
  MACBETH. I'll go no more.	
	
  MACBETH. Infected be the 'air whereon they ride,	
	
  MACBETH. No, nor more fearful.	
	
  MACBETH. Prithee, see there! Behold! Look! Lo! How say you?	
	
  MACBETH. The rest is labor, which is not used for you.	
	
  MACBETH. They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,	
	
  MACBETH. To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.	
	
  MACBETH. Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;	
	
  MACBETH. Which of you have done this?	
	
  MACBETH. [Aside.] Two truths are told,	
	
  MACDUFF. And so do I.	
	
  MACDUFF. He has no children. All my pretty ones?	
	
  MACDUFF. I have lost my hopes.	
	
  MACDUFF. O gentle lady,	
	
  MACDUFF. The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?	
	
  MACDUFF. What concern they?	
	
  MAECENAS. Caesar must think	
	
  MAECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.	
	
  MALCOLM. But I have none. The king-becoming graces,	
	
  MALCOLM. Let every soldier hew him down a bough,	
	
  MALCOLM. Macduff is missing, and your noble son.	
	
  MALCOLM. [Aside to Donalbain.] Nor our strong sorrow	
	
  MALVOLIO. 'And wish'd to see thee cross-garterd.'	
	
  MALVOLIO. 'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told me she	
	
  MALVOLIO. Fool!	
	
  MALVOLIO. Has been told so; and he says he'll stand at your door	
	
  MALVOLIO. M- But then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that	
	
  MALVOLIO. M. O. A. I. This simulation is not as the former; and	
	
  MALVOLIO. Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do	
	
  MALVOLIO. What employment have we here?	
	
  MALVOLIO. [Reads]	
	
  MARCIUS. As with a man busied about decrees:	
	
  MARCIUS. He that will give good words to thee will flatter	
	
  MARCIUS. Let the first budger die the other's slave,	
	
  MARCIUS. Sir, praise me not;	
	
  MARCIUS. Within these three hours, Tullus,	
	
  MARCUS. At that that I have kill'd, my lord- a fly.	
	
  MARCUS. Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,	
	
  MARCUS. Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child.	
	
  MARCUS. O, thus I found her straying in the park,	
	
  MARCUS. See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.	
	
  MARCUS. Who is this?- my niece, that flies away so fast?	
	
  MARDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing	
	
  MARGARELON. Turn, slave, and fight.	
	
  MARGARET. He talks of wood. It is some carpenter.	
	
  MARGARET. Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,	
	
  MARIA. A good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was	
	
  MARIA. Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits	
	
  MARIA. For the love o' God, peace!	
	
  MARIA. If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into	
	
  MARIA. Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?	
	
  MARIA. Sir, I have not you by th' hand.	
	
  MARIA. They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.	
	
  MARIA. What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not	
	
  MARIANA. Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away;	
	
  MARIANA. Merely, my lord.	
	
  MARIANA. Now I come to't, my lord:	
	
  MARSHAL. In God's name and the King's, say who thou art,	
	
  MARSHAL. [To an officer] Go bear this lance to Thomas,	
	
  MARTIUS. O brother, with the dismal'st object hurt	
	
  MARTIUS. Why dost not comfort me, and help me out	
	
  MASTER-GUNNER. Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is	
	
  MAYOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be open'd.	
	
  MAYOR. O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,	
	
  MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus	
	
  MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.	
	
  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?	
	
  MENAS. [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this	
	
  MENELAUS. I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.	
	
  MENENIUS. A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years'	
	
  MENENIUS. And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that; an he	
	
  MENENIUS. Calmly, I do beseech you.	
	
  MENENIUS. For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest,	
	
  MENENIUS. Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly?	
	
  MENENIUS. Hear me one word; beseech you, Tribunes,	
	
  MENENIUS. I think not so.	
	
  MENENIUS. I'll undertake't;	
	
  MENENIUS. Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love	
	
  MENENIUS. Now the good gods forbid	
	
  MENENIUS. Pray you be gone.	
	
  MENENIUS. Sir, sir-	
	
  MENENIUS. The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.	
	
  MENENIUS. There was a time when all the body's members	
	
  MENENIUS. Well, no more.	
	
  MENENIUS. Wondrous! Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true	
	
  MENTEITH. The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,	
	
  MERCHANT. A most incomparable man; breath'd, as it were,	
	
  MESSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius	
	
  MESSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry	
	
  MESSENGER. 'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,	
	
  MESSENGER. Antony	
	
  MESSENGER. First, madam, he is well.	
	
  MESSENGER. I crave your Highness' pardon.	
	
  MESSENGER. Lord Rivers and Lord Grey	
	
  MESSENGER. Most gracious Majesty!	
	
  MESSENGER. My lord, my lord, the French have gather'd	
	
  MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley.	
	
  MESSENGER. Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand	
	
  MESSENGER. Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.	
	
  MESSENGER. The nobles in great earnestness are going	
	
  MESSENGER. Under the Dauphin.	
	
  MESSENGER. With all my heart, my liege.                        Exit	
	
  METELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs	
	
  MICHAEL. Where's our General?	
	
  MIRANDA. Do you love me?	
	
  MIRANDA. Never till this day	
	
  MIRANDA. O dear father,	
	
  MIRANDA. What is't? a spirit?	
	
  MISTRESS QUICKLY, servant to Doctor Caius	
	
  MONTAGUE. But I have reasons strong and forcible.	
	
  MONTANO.                  But is he often thus?	
	
  MONTANO. Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.	
	
  MONTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm,	
	
  MONTJOY. The Constable of France.	
	
  MORTIMER. True; and thou seest that I no issue have,	
	
  MOTH.      If she be made of white and red,	
	
  MOTH. An excellent device! So, if any of the audience hiss, you may	
	
  MOTH. And out of heart, master; all those three I will prove.	
	
  MOTH. Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?	
	
  MOTH. Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.	
	
  MOTH. Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the	
	
  MOTH. Speak you this in my praise, master?	
	
  MOTH. They do not mark me, and that brings me out.	
	
  MOTH. [Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast of	
	
  MOULDY. Yea, an't please you.	
	
  MOWBRAY. I take it up; and by that sword I swear	
	
  MOWBRAY. Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.	
	
  MOWBRAY. Yea, but our valuation shall be such	
	
  MRS. FORD. But is my husband coming?	
	
  MRS. FORD. How might we disguise him?	
	
  MRS. FORD. I would my husband would meet him in this	
	
  MRS. FORD. Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be	
	
  MRS. FORD. Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.	
	
  MRS. FORD. Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never	
	
  MRS. FORD. What think you? May we, with the warrant of	
	
  MRS. FORD. Why, man, why?	
	
  MRS. FORD. } Away, away.	
	
  MRS. OVERDONE. Well, well! there's one yonder arrested and carried	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Are you not asham'd? I think you have kill'd the	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Fear not you that. Go get us properties	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Hang the trifle, woman; take the honour. What	
	
  MRS. PAGE. He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such	
	
  MRS. PAGE. I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Nay, but he'll be here presently; let's go dress	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Quickly, quickly! Is the buck-basket-	
	
  MRS. PAGE. The truth being known,	
	
  MRS. PAGE. What? Thou liest. Sir Alice Ford! These knights	
	
  MRS. PAGE. You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.	
	
  MUSTARDSEED. What's your will?	
	
  Made more or less by thy continual haste:	
	
  Making a famine where abundance lies,	
	
  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.	
	
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!	
	
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.	
	
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.	
	
  Marg. Get you some of this distill'd carduus benedictus and lay it	
	
  Marg. I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a	
	
  Marg. Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.	
	
  Mer. A challenge, on my life.	
	
  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in	
	
  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay	
	
  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is	
	
  Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!	
	
  Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him	
	
  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art	
	
  Mess. He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.	
	
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:	
	
  Mess. O, he's return'd, and as pleasant as ever he was.	
	
  Might'st thou perceive austerely in his eye	
	
  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;	
	
  More than enough am I that vex thee still,	
	
  Most true it is, that I have looked on truth	
	
  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!	
	
  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:	
	
  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,	
	
  My mistress and her sister stays for you.	
	
  My name be buried where my body is,	
	
  My spirit is thine the better part of me,	
	
  My wife, more careful for the latter-born,	
	
  NATHANIEL. Peter, didst ever see the like?	
	
  NATHANIEL. When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander-	
	
  NERISSA. And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd	
	
  NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.	
	
  NERISSA. What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of	
	
  NESTOR. A woman of quick sense.	
	
  NESTOR. Ay, my good son.	
	
  NESTOR. Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice;	
	
  NESTOR. True. The purpose is perspicuous even as substance	
	
  NESTOR.Who, Thersites?	
	
  NORFOLK. A gracious king that pardons all offences	
	
  NORFOLK. Believe it, this is true:	
	
  NORFOLK. I am sorry	
	
  NORFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element	
	
  NORFOLK. Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.	
	
  NORFOLK. We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Beshrew me, but his passions move me so	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. What would your Grace have done unto him now?	
	
  NURSE. O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!	
	
  NYM. I am not Barbason: you cannot conjure me. I have an humour to	
	
  NYM. I have operations in my head which be humours of	
	
  NYM. The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.	
	
  NYM. With both the humours, I.	
	
  Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend	
	
  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,	
	
  Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,	
	
  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,	
	
  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.	
	
  North. Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.	
	
  North. Farewell, good brother. We shall thrive, I trust.	
	
  Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?	
	
  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,	
	
  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!	
	
  Nurse. Even so lies she,	
	
  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,	
	
  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?	
	
  Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.	
	
  Nurse. O God's Lady dear!	
	
  Nurse. Peter!	
	
  Nurse. There's no trust,	
	
  Nurse. What's this? what's this?	
	
  O call not me to justify the wrong,	
	
  O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,	
	
  O let me true in love but truly write,	
	
  O no, thy love though much, is not so great,	
	
  O, if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak,	
	
  OBERON. Do you amend it, then; it lies in you.	
	
  OBERON. Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.	
	
  OCTAVIA. All which time	
	
  OCTAVIA. Good my lord,	
	
  OCTAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.	
	
  OCTAVIUS. Let us do so, for we are at the stake,	
	
  OLD ATHENIAN. If in her marriage my consent be missing,	
	
  OLD LADY. An hundred marks? By this light, I'll ha' more!	
	
  OLD LADY. How tastes it? Is it bitter? Forty pence, no.	
	
  OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,	
	
  OLIVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,	
	
  OLIVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.	
	
  OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;	
	
  OLIVIA. 'What is your parentage?'	
	
  OLIVIA. Ay, my lord, this same.	
	
  OLIVIA. From the Count Orsino, is it?	
	
  OLIVIA. God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand	
	
  OLIVIA. Heaven restore thee!	
	
  OLIVIA. I do I know not what, and fear to find	
	
  OLIVIA. Most wonderful!	
	
  OLIVIA. Prithee read i' thy right wits.	
	
  OLIVIA. Tell him he shall not speak with me.	
	
  OLIVIA. What manner of man?	
	
  OLIVIA. Who has done this, Sir Andrew?	
	
  OLIVIA. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?	
	
  ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,	
	
  ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?	
	
  ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me	
	
  ORLANDO. I hope so.	
	
  ORLANDO. I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.	
	
  ORLANDO. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.	
	
  ORLANDO. Just as high as my heart.	
	
  ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.	
	
  ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.	
	
  ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.	
	
  ORLANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?	
	
  ORLANDO. With all my heart, good youth.	
	
  ORLANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in	
	
  ORLEANS. O brave spirit!	
	
  ORLEANS. We are enow yet living in the field	
	
  OTHELLO.                                Indeed!	
	
  OTHELLO.                           The sooner, sweet, for you.	
	
  OTHELLO.                       O fool! fool! fool!	
	
  OTHELLO.                      What is the matter here?	
	
  OTHELLO.                    Had it pleased heaven	
	
  OTHELLO.               And so she did.	
	
  OTHELLO.             'Tis well I am found by you.	
	
  OTHELLO.             What dost thou say, Iago?	
	
  OTHELLO.         Why, why is this?	
	
  OTHELLO. Ay, and for that thou diest.	
	
  OTHELLO. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.	
	
  OTHELLO. Excellent good. [A trumpet within.] What trumpet is that	
	
  OTHELLO. Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate	
	
  OTHELLO. Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?	
	
  OTHELLO. I am glad to see you mad.	
	
  OTHELLO. I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.	
	
  OTHELLO. I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!	
	
  OTHELLO. Look, how he laughs already!	
	
  OTHELLO. Most veritable; therefore look to't well.	
	
  OTHELLO. Nor send you out o' the way?	
	
  OTHELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!	
	
  OTHELLO. Say you?	
	
  OTHELLO. Soft you; a word or two before you go.	
	
  OTHELLO. The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.	
	
  OTHELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,	
	
  OTHELLO. What, not a whore?	
	
  OTHELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless	
	
  OTHELLO. Yes, 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.	
	
  OXFORD. I thought no less. It is his policy	
	
  Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,	
	
  Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,	
	
  Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?	
	
  Old Man. 'Tis poor mad Tom.	
	
  On purpose laid to make the taker mad.	
	
  Once did I get him bound and sent him home,	
	
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,	
	
  Oph. Good my lord,	
	
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep	
	
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,	
	
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,	
	
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?	
	
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,	
	
  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?	
	
  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;	
	
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,	
	
  Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,	
	
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-	
	
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;	
	
  Osw. Ay, madam.	
	
  Osw. I'll not be strucken, my lord.	
	
  Osw. No, madam.	
	
  Osw. Where may we set our horses?	
	
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!	
	
  Others, but stewards of their excellence:	
	
  PAGE, to Falstaff	
	
  PAGE. A cur, sir.	
	
  PAGE. Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.	
	
  PAGE. How fares my noble lord?	
	
  PAGE. I think you know him: Master Doctor Caius, the	
	
  PAGE. Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great fighter,	
	
  PAGE. Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his	
	
  PAGE. Now, Master Slender! Love him, daughter Anne-	
	
  PAGE. Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the	
	
  PAGE. We are come to you to do a good office, Master	
	
  PAGE. Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go loose	
	
  PAGE. You must speak louder; my master is deaf.	
	
  PAINTER. Indifferent.	
	
  PAINTER. The gods preserve ye!	
	
  PANDARUS. An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's- well,	
	
  PANDARUS. Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.	
	
  PANDARUS. But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and	
	
  PANDARUS. Friend, know me better: I am the Lord Pandarus.	
	
  PANDARUS. Grace! Not so, friend; honour and lordship are my titles.	
	
  PANDARUS. He is elder.	
	
  PANDARUS. I will be with you, niece, by and by.	
	
  PANDARUS. Is he here, say you? It's more than I know, I'll be	
	
  PANDARUS. Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other day	
	
  PANDARUS. Pretty, i' faith.	
	
  PANDARUS. That's Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and	
	
  PANDARUS. Was he angry?	
	
  PANDARUS. Well, well! Why, have you any discretion? Have you any	
	
  PANDARUS. Where are my tears? Rain, to lay this wind, or my heart	
	
  PANDARUS. YOU have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th'	
	
  PANDARUS. [Within] What's all the doors open here?	
	
  PANDULPH. Give me leave to speak.	
	
  PANDULPH. You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,	
	
  PARIS. 'Tis Troilus' fault. Come, come to field with him.	
	
  PARIS. Sweet, above thought I love thee.                     Exeunt	
	
  PAROLLES, a follower of Bertram	
	
  PAROLLES. A drum now of the enemy's!	
	
  PAROLLES. Away! th'art a knave.	
	
  PAROLLES. Commit it, Count.	
	
  PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-	
	
  PAROLLES. I love not many words.                          Exit	
	
  PAROLLES. I praise God for you.                         Exeunt	
	
  PAROLLES. It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall	
	
  PAROLLES. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf	
	
  PAROLLES. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!	
	
  PAROLLES. Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-	
	
  PAROLLES. The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of	
	
  PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown	
	
  PAROLLES. When he was predominant.	
	
  PAROLLES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on,	
	
  PATRICIANS. I would they were a-bed.	
	
  PATROCLUS. Both take and give.	
	
  PATROCLUS. Jove bless great Ajax!	
	
  PATROCLUS. Well said, Adversity! and what needs these tricks?	
	
  PEASEBLOSSOM. Peaseblossom.	
	
  PEDANT. Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!     Exit from above	
	
  PEDANT. Sir, at the farthest for a week or two;	
	
  PEMBROKE. All murders past do stand excus'd in this;	
	
  PEMBROKE. When workmen strive to do better than well,	
	
  PERCY. No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court,	
	
  PETER. Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,	
	
  PETER. Peter, forsooth.	
	
  PETRUCHIO. 'A has a little gall'd me, I confess;	
	
  PETRUCHIO. A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

  SERVANT. He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.	
	
  SERVANT. He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight.	
	
  SERVANT. I'll fetch him presently.                       Exit.	
	
  SERVANT. Sir John!	
	
  SERVANT. Sodden business! There's a stew'd phrase indeed!	
	
  SERVANT. Wholly, sir.	
	
  SERVANTS. My lord! my lord!	
	
  SERVINGMAN. My lord, your son was gone before I came.

  SHALLOW. Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.	
	
  SHALLOW. Have with you, mine host.	
	
  SHALLOW. I thank thee with all my heart, kind Master Bardolph.	
	
  SHALLOW. It doth so.	
	
  SHALLOW. It is very just. Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me	
	
  SHALLOW. Nay, but understand me.	
	
  SHALLOW. She never could away with me.	
	
  SHALLOW. That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith, Sir	
	
  SHALLOW. There, is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor. That

  SHYLOCK. Antonio is a good man.	
	
  SHYLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica;	
	
  SHYLOCK. I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?	
	
  SHYLOCK. I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond.	
	
  SHYLOCK. O noble judge! O excellent young man!	
	
  SHYLOCK. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft	
	
  SHYLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:	
	
  SHYLOCK. Why, look you, how you storm!

  SOMERSET. Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,	
	
  SON. And be all traitors that do so?	
	
  SON. If he were dead, you'ld weep for him; if you would not, it

  SUFFOLK. My amen to't!	
	
  SUFFOLK. Nay, my lord,

  Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.	
	
  Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain;	
	
  So am I as the rich whose blessed key,	
	
  So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?	
	
  So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,	
	
  So shall those blots that do with me remain,	
	
  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand	
	
  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.	
	
  Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be'st the man	
	
  Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke	
	
  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,	
	
  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,	
	
  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'	
	
  TALBOT. A maid, they say.	
	
  TALBOT. Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?	
	
  TALBOT. Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan.	
	
  TALBOT. Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,	
	
  TALBOT. Thanks, gentle Duke. But where is Pucelle now?	
	
  TALBOT. Where is my other life? Mine own is gone.	
	
  TALBOT. Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?	
	
  TAMORA. I know not what it means; away with her!	
	
  TAMORA. Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora:	
	
  TAMORA. These are my ministers, and come with me.	
	
  TAMORA. Titus, I am come to talk with thee.	
	
  TAMORA. Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?

  THESEUS. Go, Philostrate,	
	
  THESEUS. His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing im paired,

  THYREUS. Hear it apart.	
	
  TIMON. 'Tis not well mended so; it is but botch'd.	
	
  TIMON. A mere satiety of commendations;	
	
  TIMON. Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!	
	
  TIMON. Be a whore still; they love thee not that use thee.	
	
  TIMON. Commend me to him; I will send his ransom;	
	
  TIMON. E'en so, sir, as I say. [To To POET] And for thy fiction,	
	
  TIMON. How lik'st thou this picture, Apemantus?	
	
  TIMON. How shall she be endow'd,	
	
  TIMON. If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.	
	
  TIMON. If I name thee.	
	
  TIMON. Look who comes here; will you be chid?	
	
  TIMON. Near! Why then, another time I'll hear thee. I prithee let's	
	
  TIMON. O my friends,	
	
  TIMON. Pray entertain them; give them guide to us.	
	
  TIMON. That's a deed thou't die for.	
	
  TIMON. There's never a one of you but trusts a knave	
	
  TIMON. Thou sun that comforts, burn. Speak and be hang'd!	
	
  TIMON. Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand;	
	
  TIMON. Wherefore?	
	
  TIMON. Why dost thou seek me out?	
	
  TIMON. You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than dinner of	
	
  TIMON. Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.	
	
  TITANIA. Come now, a roundel and a fairy song;	
	
  TITANIA. Out of this wood do not desire to go;	
	
  TITINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.	
	
  TITUS. 'But!' How if that fly had a father and mother?	
	
  TITUS. 'Tis sure enough, an you knew how;	
	
  TITUS. Are they thy ministers? What are they call'd?	
	
  TITUS. Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.	
	
  TITUS. How, sir! Are you in earnest then, my lord?	
	
  TITUS. I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.	
	
  TITUS. It doth, my worthy lord, and in this match	
	
  TITUS. No, foolish Tribune, no; no son of mine-	
	
  TITUS. O happy man! they have befriended thee.	
	
  TITUS. Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,	
	
  TITUS. Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come let me see it.	
	
  TITUS. Traitors, avaunt! Where is the Emperor's guard?	
	
  TITUS. Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,	
	
  TITUS. Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be	
	
  TRANIO. A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!	
	
  TRANIO. Ay, and he'll tame her.	
	
  TRANIO. Even he, Biondello.	
	
  TRANIO. He hath some meaning in his mad attire.	
	
  TRANIO. Master, some show to welcome us to town.	
	
  TRANIO. Mi perdonato, gentle master mine;	
	
  TRANIO. Of all mad matches, never was the like.	
	
  TRANIO. Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?	
	
  TRANIO. Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.	
	
  TRAVERS and MORTON, retainers of Northumberland	
	
  TRINCULO. A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of	
	
  TRINCULO. By this light, a most perfidious and drunken	
	
  TRINCULO. If these be true spies which I wear in my head,	
	
  TRINCULO. This is the tune of our catch, play'd by the	
	
  TROILUS. Accept distracted thanks.	
	
  TROILUS. And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.	
	
  TROILUS. Come, kiss; and let us part.	
	
  TROILUS. Fie, fie, my brother!	
	
  TROILUS. Good brother, come you hither;	
	
  TROILUS. Hear why I speak it, love.	
	
  TROILUS. I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels	
	
  TROILUS. Let me read.	
	
  TROILUS. O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus-	
	
  TROILUS. O traitor Diomed! Turn thy false face, thou traitor,	
	
  TROILUS. Still have I tarried.	
	
  TROILUS. What offends you, lady?	
	
  TROILUS. Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?	
	
  TROILUS. You understand me not that tell me so.	
	
  TULLUS AUFIDIUS, General of the Volscians	
	
  TWO GAOLERS	
	
  TYRREL. I humbly take my leave.                           Exit	
	
  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,	
	
  Than I stand debted to this gentleman.	
	
  Than public means which public manners breeds.	
	
  That I have frequent been with unknown minds,	
	
  That I was sent for nothing but a rope!	
	
  That did not better for my life provide,	
	
  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:	
	
  That here and there his fury had committed.	
	
  That is so proud thy service to despise,	
	
  That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,	
	
  That poor retention could not so much hold,	
	
  That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.	
	
  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,	
	
  That you are you, so dignifies his story.	
	
  That, undividable, incorporate,	
	
  The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,	
	
  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,	
	
  The earth can yield me but a common grave,	
	
  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are	
	
  The lily I condemned for thy hand,	
	
  The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.	
	
  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,	
	
  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,	
	
  The ship is in her trim; the merry wind	
	
  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,	
	
  Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)	
	
  Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,	
	
  There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down	
	
  Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,	
	
  Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command	
	
  They can be meek that have no other cause.	
	
  They say this town is full of cozenage;	
	
  This chain you had of me; can you deny it?	
	
  This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner;	
	
  Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,	
	
  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee	
	
  Thou know'st we parted; but perhaps, my son,	
	
  Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,	
	
  Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,	
	
  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,	
	
  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,	
	
  Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.	
	
  Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,	
	
  Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,	
	
  To be diseased ere that there was true needing.	
	
  To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,	
	
  To find out shames and idle hours in me,	
	
  To know the reason of this strange restraint.	
	
  To march in ranks of better equipage:	
	
  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?	
	
  To quit the penalty and to ransom him.	
	
  To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.	
	
  To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,	
	
  To-day did dine together. So befall my soul	
	
  Two other like Gentlemen	
	
  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.	
	
  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;	
	
  ULYSSES. At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus.	
	
  ULYSSES. Here comes himself to guide you.	
	
  ULYSSES. I'll bring you to the gates.	
	
  ULYSSES. May worthy Troilus be half-attach'd	
	
  ULYSSES. She will sing any man at first sight.	
	
  ULYSSES. There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles	
	
  ULYSSES. What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,	
	
  ULYSSES. [Aside] 'A would have ten shares.	
	
  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:	
	
  Upon mine hostess there; good sir, make haste.	
	
  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,	
	
  Urs. I will, lady.	
	
  Use power with power, and slay me not by art,	
	
  VALERIA. Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you	
	
  VALERIA. Well then, farewell.                           Exeunt	
	
  VARRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:	
	
  VARRO,     servant to Brutus	
	
  VARRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.	
	
  VENTIDIUS. Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now	
	
  VERNON. Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you;	
	
  VINCENTIO. Carry me to the gaol!	
	
  VINCENTIO. What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make	
	
  VINCENTIO. You shall not choose but drink before you go;	
	
  VIOLA. And what should I do in Illyria?	
	
  VIOLA. Excellently done, if God did all.	
	
  VIOLA. I Pity YOU.	
	
  VIOLA. I know of none,	
	
  VIOLA. I will acquit you.	
	
  VIOLA. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for	
	
  VIOLA. No, my lord, not I.	
	
  VIOLA. On your attendance, my lord, here.	
	
  VIOLA. That you do think you are not what you are.	
	
  VIOLA. Too well what love women to men may owe.	
	
  VIOLA. Who governs here?	
	
  VIOLA. You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me;	
	
  VIRGILIA. I am glad to see your ladyship.	
	
  VIRGILIA. The gods grant them true!	
	
  VIRGILIA. Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes: the Senate has	
	
  VOLUMNIA. I' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm; there will be large	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment	
	
  VOLUMNIA. This is a poor epitome of yours,	
	
  Ver. Deliver what you will, I'll say 'tis so.	
	
  Verg. And we must do it wisely.	
	
  Verg. By'r lady, I think it be so.	
	
  Verg. Yes, in truth it is, sir.	
	
  WARWICK is hoarse with calling thee to arms.	
	
  WARWICK. And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,	
	
  WARWICK. As surely as my soul intends to live	
	
  WARWICK. Both which we doubt not but your Majesty	
	
  WARWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.	
	
  WARWICK. Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.	
	
  WARWICK. Here comes the heavy issue of dead Harry.	
	
  WARWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.	
	
  WARWICK. Less noise! less noise!	
	
  WARWICK. My lord, I found the Prince in the next room,	
	
  WARWICK. No, 'tis impossible he should escape;	
	
  WARWICK. See how the pangs of death do make him grin	
	
  WARWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;	
	
  WARWICK. The Cardinal's not my better in the field.	
	
  WARWICK. Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum.	
	
  WARWICK. True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.	
	
  WARWICK. Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost-	
	
  WARWICK. Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?	
	
  WATCH. Enter, go in; the market-bell is rung.

  WILLIAM. I do, sir.

  Well, sir, I thank you.	
	
  Were it not sinful then striving to mend,	
	
  West. My liege, this haste was hot in question	
	
  What observation mad'st thou in this case	
	
  What's new to speak, what now to register,	
	
  When I am dull with care and melancholy,	
	
  When I perceive that men as plants increase,	
	
  When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow	
	
  When love converted from the thing it was	
	
  When not to be, receives reproach of being,	
	
  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,	
	
  When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie,	
	
  Where I will walk till thou return to me.	
	
  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,	
	
  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:	
	
  Which he forswore most monstrously to have.	
	
  Which labouring for invention bear amis	
	
  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,	
	
  Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd,	
	
  Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which	
	
  Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,	
	
  Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,	
	
  Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.	
	
  Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,	
	
  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.	
	
  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,	
	
  Why with the time do I not glance aside	
	
  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?	
	
  Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

  YORK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.	
	
  YORK. About what?

  YORK. Bring forth that sorceress, condemn'd to burn.	
	
  YORK. Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.	
	
  YORK. For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,	
	
  YORK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,	
	
  YORK. I shall be, if I claim by open war.	
	
  YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you call me.	
	
  YORK. It would beseem the Lord Northumberland	
	
  YORK. Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.	
	
  YORK. My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg	
	
  YORK. O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts:	
	
  YORK. Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles!	
	
  YORK. Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords;	
	
  YORK. The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed;	
	
  YORK. This is my servant: hear him, noble Prince.	
	
  YORK. Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?	
	
  YORK. Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.	
	
  YORK. Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?	
	
  YORK. [Within] My liege, beware; look to thyself;	
	
  Yet be most proud of that which I compile,	
	
  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,	
	
  You come not home because you have no stomach,	
	
  Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner!
