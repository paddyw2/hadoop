     Exit.	
	
     Farewell, dear sister; farewell, my Lord of Gloucester.	
	
     Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.	
	
     For these domestic and particular broils	
	
     For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,	
	
     From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en	
	
     Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my	
	
     Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,	
	
     Half my love with him, half my care and duty.	
	
     Have a command to tend you?	
	
     Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.	
	
     He smil'd at it. I told him you were coming:	
	
     He'll shape his old course in a country new.	
	
     Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray	
	
     His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!	
	
     His word was still	
	
     How now? Where's the King?	
	
     Humanity must perforce prey on itself,	
	
     I am the King himself.	
	
     I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,	
	
     I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,	
	
     I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,	
	
     I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,	
	
     I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen	
	
     I will keep still with my philosopher.	
	
     I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,	
	
     I'll bring you comfort.	
	
     If he distaste it, let him to our sister,	
	
     If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,	
	
     Improper for a slave.

     Into this scattered kingdom, who already,	
	
     Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.	
	
     It is thy business that I go about.	
	
     It were a delicate stratagem to shoe	
	
     Knowing naught (like dogs) but following.	
	
     Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.	
	
     Let me unseal the letter.	
	
     Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,

     Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!

     Met I my father with his bleeding rings,	
	
     Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.	
	
     Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.	
	
     My lady charg'd my duty in this business.	
	
     My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.	
	
     My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;	
	
     Nay, send in time.	
	
     No unchaste action or dishonoured step,

     Should have him thus restrain'd.	
	
     Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter,	
	
     So farewell to you both.	
	
     Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,	
	
     Some that will thank you, making just report	
	
     Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up!	
	
     Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,	
	
     Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.	
	
     Take her, or leave her?	
	
     Th' untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind up	
	
     Than now to bid you hold.	
	
     That by thy comfortable beams I may

     That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty	
	
     That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,	
	
     That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.	
	
     That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,	
	
     That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,	
	
     That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!	
	
     The King hath cause to plain.	
	
     The battle done, and they within our power,	
	
     The dark and vicious place where thee he got	
	
     The injuries that they themselves procure	
	
     The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,	
	
     The shame which here it suffers.	
	
     The true blank of thine eye.	
	
     The younger rises when the old doth fall.             Exit.	
	
     Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine	
	
     There shall he sit till noon.	
	
     They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murther	
	
     This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim, fair	
	
     This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.	
	
     This weaves itself perforce into my business.	
	
     Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!	
	
     Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.	
	
     Thy comforts can do me no good at all;	
	
     Thy token of reprieve.	
	
     To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out	
	
     To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,	
	
     To do upon respect such violent outrage.	
	
     To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.	
	
     To keep base life afoot. Return with her?	
	
     To lead him where he would. His roguish madness	
	
     To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,	
	
     To some retention and appointed guard;	
	
     To stand 's auspicious mistress.	
	
     To the great love I bear you -

     Truly, however else.	
	
     Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,	
	
     Was kinder to his father than my daughters	
	
     We could control them. If you will come to me	
	
     What are you, sir?	
	
     What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.	
	
     What safe and nicely I might well delay	
	
     When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.	
	
     When the rash mood is on.	
	
     Wherefore was that cry?	
	
     Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away	
	
     Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,	
	
     Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-	
	
     Which, if convenience will not allow,	
	
     Who hath most fortunately been inform'd	
	
     Who should express her goodliest. You have seen

     With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd.	
	
     With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!	
	
     With something rich about me. From that place	
	
     Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.	
	
     Yet to be known shortens my made intent.	
	
     You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!	
	
     You owe me no subscription. Then let fall	
	
     You should not use me so.	
	
     Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father.

    An hour or more, not meaning any harm?	
	
    An if my face were but as fair as yours,	
	
    An indistinct regard.	
	
    An ordinary groom is for such payment.	
	
    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;	
	
    And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;	
	
    And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.	
	
    And Caesar shall go forth.	
	
    And Cassio kill'd?	
	
    And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.	
	
    And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,	
	
    And Henry is my King, Warwick his subject.	
	
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.	
	
    And I am sick at heart.	
	
    And I challenge law-attorneys are denied me;	
	
    And I do fear them.	
	
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine	
	
    And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!	
	
    And I in such a poverty of grace,	
	
    And I may live to do you kindness if	
	
    And I shall have no power to follow you.	
	
    And I thus humble ever.	
	
    And I will bring him to the Capitol.	
	
    And I will fit thee with the remedy.	
	
    And I will overhear their conference.	
	
    And I will use him for my minstrelsy.	
	
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear	
	
    And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape	
	
    And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.	
	
    And I- like one lost in a thorny wood	
	
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,	
	
    And Richard falls in height of all his pride.	
	
    And Somerset another goodly mast?	
	
    And William de la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk.	
	
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'	
	
    And after fight with them?	
	
    And afterward by substitute betroth'd	
	
    And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.	
	
    And all his lands and goods confiscated.	
	
    And all out of an empty coffer;	
	
    And all the brothers too- and yet I know not.	
	
    And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword	
	
    And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.	
	
    And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?	
	
    And all their ministers attend on him.	
	
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.	
	
    And all unlook'd for from your Highness' mouth.	
	
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,	
	
    And an adopted name of privilege-	
	
    And are enforc'd from our most quiet there	
	
    And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore	
	
    And as imagination bodies forth	
	
    And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,	
	
    And ask him what's the reason of these arms.	
	
    And at our stamp here, o'er and o'er one falls;	
	
    And at the dean'ry, where a priest attends,	
	
    And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,	
	
    And be a boy right out.                       [JUNO alights]	
	
    And be inheritor of thy desire.	
	
    And be not peevish-fond in great designs.	
	
    And be you silent and attentive too,	
	
    And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.	
	
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;	
	
    And beggar'd yours forever?	
	
    And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,	
	
    And bid him come and banquet at thy house;	
	
    And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,	
	
    And bid that strumpet, your unhallowed dam,	
	
    And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;	
	
    And bind us further to you.	
	
    And blindfold death not let me see my son.	
	
    And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go.	
	
    And both are ready in their offices	
	
    And bow my knee before his Majesty;	
	
    And breathe twice, and cry 'so, so,'	
	
    And bring away the armour that is there.	
	
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.	
	
    And brought in matter that should feed this fire;	
	
    And brought us thus together?	
	
    And but attended by a simple guard,	
	
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.	
	
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake	
	
    And by his hollow whistling in the leaves	
	
    And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,	
	
    And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.	
	
    And by the way let us recount our dreams.             Exeunt	
	
    And call it cunning. Do, an if you will.	
	
    And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus;	
	
    And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,	
	
    And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!	
	
    And certain stars shot madly from their spheres	
	
    And charges him, my lord, with such a time	
	
    And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.	
	
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;	
	
    And come, Egeus; you shall go with me;	
	
    And common profit of his country!	
	
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,	
	
    And cordial to me, have I not found it	
	
    And craves your company for speedy counsel.	
	
    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!	
	
    And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave-	
	
    And dallies with the innocence of love,	
	
    And dare me to the desert with thy sword.	
	
    And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,	
	
    And death's dishonourable victory	
	
    And did supply thee at thy garden-house	
	
    And disinherited thine only son.	
	
    And dispossessing all my other parts	
	
    And do not play in wench-like words with that	
	
    And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.	
	
    And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father	
	
    And down goes all before them. Still be kind,	
	
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.	
	
    And drive the English forth the bounds of France.	
	
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed	
	
    And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,	
	
    And ere I take this charm from off her sight,	
	
    And even as I was then is Percy now.	
	
    And even there, methinks, an angel spake:	
	
    And even these three days have I watch'd	
	
    And every one his love-feat will advance	
	
    And evils imminent, and on her knee	
	
    And fall into our rustic revelry.	
	
    And far enough from court too.	
	
    And father of that chaste dishonoured dame,	
	
    And feast the army; we have store to do't,	
	
    And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,	
	
    And find me worse provided.	
	
    And find the welcome of a noble foe.	
	
    And fits the mounting spirit like myself;	
	
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.	
	
    And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,	
	
    And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur	
	
    And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive	
	
    And for more slander to thy dismal seat,	
	
    And for that name, which is no part of thee,	
	
    And for the love he beareth to your daughter,	
	
    And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords.	
	
    And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal	
	
    And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French;	
	
    And four shall quickly draw out my command,	
	
    And from Pope Innocent the legate here,	
	
    And from the common'st creature pluck a glove	
	
    And from your womb where you imprisoned were	
	
    And future ages groan for this foul act;	
	
    And gave the tongue a helpful ornament-	
	
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.	
	
    And give him chastisement for this abuse.	
	
    And give me signs of future accidents;             [Thunder]	
	
    And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll.	
	
    And give you to the gods.	
	
    And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.	
	
    And go well satisfied to France again.	
	
    And good supporters are you.	
	
    And grapple thee unto a pagan shore,	
	
    And groaning underneath this age's yoke,	
	
    And guardian of their bones.	
	
    And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.	
	
    And happily may your sweet self put on	
	
    And hardly kept our countrymen together,	
	
    And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph	
	
    And have install'd me in the diadem;	
	
    And have my learning from some true reports	
	
    And have thee reverenc'd like a blessed saint.	
	
    And he does chide with you.	
	
    And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,	
	
    And he repents not that he pays your debt;	
	
    And he shall say you are not well today.	
	
    And he that got it, sentenc'd- a young man	
	
    And he that wears the crown immortally	
	
    And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you-	
	
    And he, long traded in it, makes it seem	
	
    And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back	
	
    And hedg'd me by his wit to yield myself	
	
    And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!	
	
    And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,	
	
    And here have I the daintiness of ear	
	
    And here my brother, weeping at my woes.	
	
    And here the smug and sliver Trent shall run	
	
    And here's the heart that triumphs in their death	
	
    And hid the gold within that letter mention'd,	
	
    And his affairs come to me on the wind.	
	
    And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him	
	
    And his succession granted Rome a tribute,	
	
    And hither have they sent it for her ransom.	
	
    And hold thee to my heart.	
	
    And honour'd in their issue.                     [They sing]	
	
    And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!          Exeunt	
	
    And if I did but stir out of my bed,	
	
    And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,	
	
    And if my legs were two such riding-rods,	
	
    And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,	
	
    And if we be, how dare thy joints forget	
	
    And if ye love me, as I think you do,	
	
    And in conclusion wins the King from her	
	
    And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart	
	
    And in my conscience do repute his Grace	
	
    And in no sense is meet or amiable.	
	
    And in our name, what she requires; add more,	
	
    And in that vow we have forsworn our books.	
	
    And in the essential vesture of creation	
	
    And in the meantime sojourn'd at my father's;	
	
    And in the witness of his proper ear,	
	
    And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.	
	
    And in this hand the other will I bear.	
	
    And in thy sight to die, what were it else	
	
    And interjoin their issues. So with me:	
	
    And is in full commission here for Cyprus.	
	
    And it is nothing, nothing in the world;	
	
    And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend.	
	
    And keep it from the earth.	
	
    And keep their teeth clean. So, here comes a brace.	
	
    And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.	
	
    And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,	
	
    And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,	
	
    And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy;	
	
    And lards the lean earth as he walks along.	
	
    And laugh upon the apple of her eye?	
	
    And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;	
	
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,	
	
    And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?	
	
    And leaving so his service, follow you,	
	
    And left me in reputeless banishment,	
	
    And let confusion live. Plagues incident to men,	
	
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air	
	
    And let his very breath whom thou'lt observe	
	
    And let me be a slave t' achieve that maid	
	
    And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.	
	
    And let not search and inquisition quail	
	
    And let the subject see, to make them know	
	
    And let them work. The nature of our people,	
	
    And let us do it with no show of fear-	
	
    And let us two devise to bring him thither.	
	
    And like a hungry lion did commence	
	
    And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts	
	
    And liquor likewise will I give to thee,	
	
    And little recks to find the way to heaven	
	
    And lofty proud encroaching tyranny-	
	
    And look where Publius is come to fetch me.	
	
    And lose by over-running. Know you not	
	
    And loses that it works for.	
	
    And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?	
	
    And made our footstool of security.	
	
    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,	
	
    And make a dark night too of half the day-	
	
    And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps	
	
    And make him of the like spirit to himself.	
	
    And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither	
	
    And make my wars on you. Look to't. Come on;	
	
    And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,	
	
    And make them skirr away as swift as stones	
	
    And makes each petty artire in this body	
	
    And makes him roar these accusations forth.	
	
    And many a civil monster.	
	
    And many other of great name and worth;	
	
    And mark the musical confusion	
	
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;	
	
    And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not	
	
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame	
	
    And merely to revenge him on the Emperor	
	
    And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.             Exit	
	
    And mock us with our bareness.	
	
    And more than may be gathered by thy shape.	
	
    And mounch'd, and mounch'd, and mounch'd. "Give me," quoth I.	
	
    And must advise the Emperor for his good.	
	
    And my appointments have in them a need	
	
    And my more-having would be as a sauce	
	
    And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,	
	
    And neither way inclines.	
	
    And never from this palace of dim night	
	
    And never mount to trouble you again.	
	
    And never shall have length of life enough	
	
    And new create this fault?	
	
    And no man else hath honor by his death.	
	
    And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead	
	
    And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.	
	
    And not a man of them shall have the grace,	
	
    And not deface your honour with reproach?	
	
    And not for justice? What, shall one of us,	
	
    And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch	
	
    And not the King, that doth you injuries.	
	
    And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.	
	
    And nothing grieves me heartily indeed	
	
    And now I fear that fatal prophecy.	
	
    And now be it known to you my full intent:	
	
    And now in plainness do confess to thee,	
	
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch	
	
    And now to London all the crew are gone	
	
    And now, I will unclasp a secret book,	
	
    And now, to soothe your forgery and his,	
	
    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.	
	
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,	
	
    And often up and down my sons were toss'd	
	
    And on his more advice we pardon him.	
	
    And on our actions set the name of right	
	
    And on your family's old monument	
	
    And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.	
	
    And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.	
	
    And our induction full of prosperous hope.	
	
    And our nobility will scorn the match.	
	
    And overlooks the highest-peering hills,	
	
    And pale destruction meets thee in the face.	
	
    And partly credit things that do presage.	
	
    And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since	
	
    And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till	
	
    And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds	
	
    And plodded like a man for working-days;	
	
    And pluck commiseration of his state	
	
    And portance in my travels' history;	
	
    And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.	
	
    And prays you to believe him.	
	
    And prey on garbage.	
	
    And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse,	
	
    And public reasons shall be rendered	
	
    And put it in his pocket!	
	
    And put yourself under his shroud,	
	
    And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole.	
	
    And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,	
	
    And rather like a dream than an assurance	
	
    And ready mounted are they to spit forth	
	
    And reason says you are the worthier maid.	
	
    And revel in Lavinia's treasury.	
	
    And rotten times that you shall look upon	
	
    And run a tilt at death within a chair?	
	
    And sav'd the treacherous labour of your son.	
	
    And say 'Thrice welcome, drowned Viola!'	
	
    And say I am Revenge, sent from below	
	
    And say to all the world, "This was a man!"	
	
    And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,	
	
    And see already how he doth begin	
	
    And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,	
	
    And see our pleasure herein executed.	
	
    And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself,	
	
    And send forth us to make their sorrowed render,	
	
    And sent her enemies unto the grave.	
	
    And sent you hither so unlike yourself?	
	
    And set the triple crown upon his head;	
	
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows	
	
    And shall become you well, to entreat your captain	
	
    And shall these labours and these honours die?	
	
    And she died singing it. That song tonight	
	
    And she is fair and, fairer than that word,	
	
    And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar's Caesar.	
	
    And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument.	
	
    And should you fall he is the next will mount;	
	
    And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,	
	
    And shut the gates for safety of ourselves,	
	
    And simpler than the infancy of truth.	
	
    And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,	
	
    And sits as one new risen from a dream.	
	
    And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention	
	
    And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.	
	
    And so I hear he doth account me too.	
	
    And so I love and honour thee and thine,	
	
    And so am come abroad to see the world.	
	
    And so doth yours: your fault was not your folly;	
	
    And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by	
	
    And so he'll die; and, rising so again,	
	
    And so once more return and tell his Grace.	
	
    And so return to you, and nothing else?	
	
    And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.	
	
    And so your follies fight against yourself.	
	
    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,	
	
    And so, without more circumstance at all,	
	
    And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'	
	
    And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,	
	
    And soundly too. Your houses!	
	
    And speak off half a dozen dang'rous words,	
	
    And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms	
	
    And stablish quietness on every side.	
	
    And stands upon the honour of his birth,	
	
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,	
	
    And still enjoy thy regal dignity.	
	
    And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,	
	
    And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.	
	
    And subjects none abroad; pray you, look in.	
	
    And such a flood of greatness fell on you-	
	
    And suffer not dishonour to approach	
	
    And sure he is an honorable man.	
	
    And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.	
	
    And sworn unto the practices of France	
	
    And take his bottle from him. When that's gone	
	
    And take thy office from thee on my peril.	
	
    And takes away the stomach- such are the rich	
	
    And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,	
	
    And tell him where I stay; give the like notice	
	
    And tell me, in the modesty of honour,	
	
    And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth	
	
    And tempt us not to bear above our power!	
	
    And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns	
	
    And that a strange one too, which did awake me;	
	
    And that dear saint which then I weeping follow'd-	
	
    And that hereafter ages may behold	
	
    And that it was great pity, so it was,	
	
    And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world	
	
    And that same prayer doth teach us all to render	
	
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps	
	
    And that thy summer bred us no increase,	
	
    And that were much he should, for he is given	
	
    And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.	
	
    And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.	
	
    And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,	
	
    And the best half should have return'd to him,	
	
    And the detention of long-since-due debts,	
	
    And the late marriage made of none effect;	
	
    And the particular accidents gone by	
	
    And the third hour of drowsy morning name.	
	
    And the very ports they blow,	
	
    And then 'twill end.	
	
    And then a mind put in't, either our brags	
	
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.	
	
    And then he runs straight and even.	
	
    And then it was when the unhappy King	
	
    And then they call'd me foul adulteress,	
	
    And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,	
	
    And then when poisoned hours had bound me up	
	
    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;	
	
    And there I stood amazed for a while,	
	
    And there is nothing left remarkable	
	
    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell	
	
    And therefore am I bold and resolute.                 Exeunt	
	
    And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.	
	
    And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,	
	
    And therefore look you call me Ganymede.	
	
    And therefore put I on the countenance	
	
    And therefore, if you say no more than this,	
	
    And therein reverenc'd for their lawful king.	
	
    And these assume but valour's excrement	
	
    And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,	
	
    And they did make no noise- in such a night,	
	
    And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;	
	
    And they that are most galled with my folly,	
	
    And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge	
	
    And think of each thing well.  [Aside to ARIEL]  Come	
	
    And this is all a liberal course allows:	
	
    And this same bias, this commodity,	
	
    And this soft courage makes your followers faint.	
	
    And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,	
	
    And those that leave their valiant bones in France,	
	
    And thou and I sit round about some fountain,	
	
    And thou hast given me most bitter terms.	
	
    And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!	
	
    And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st.	
	
    And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,	
	
    And thou-	
	
    And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,	
	
    And thrice again, to make up nine.	
	
    And throw the rider headlong in the lists,	
	
    And throwing but shows of service on their lords	
	
    And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,	
	
    And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me,	
	
    And till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman.	
	
    And to bestow your pity on me; for	
	
    And to his image, which methought did promise	
	
    And to my humble seat conform myself.	
	
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse	
	
    And to that youth he calls his Rosalind	
	
    And to the last bended their light on me.	
	
    And to what end, is this? Nay, ladies, fear not:	
	
    And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,	
	
    And touching now the point of human skill,	
	
    And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape;	
	
    And try your hap against the Irishmen?	
	
    And tugg'd for life, and was by strength subdu'd.	
	
    And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,	
	
    And uncle Worcester. A plague upon it!	
	
    And undiscover'd come to me again	
	
    And vanish'd from our sight.	
	
    And very well appointed, as I thought,	
	
    And violenteth in a sense as strong	
	
    And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,	
	
    And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;	
	
    And we are barren and bereft of friends,	
	
    And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;	
	
    And we must take the current when it serves,	
	
    And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,	
	
    And we with sober speed will follow you.	
	
    And wear it for an honour in thy cap	
	
    And welcome all. Although the cheer be poor,	
	
    And well consider of them. Make good speed.        Exit page	
	
    And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,	
	
    And what a pitch she flew above the rest!	
	
    And what hear there for welcome but my groans?	
	
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect	
	
    And what will you do now? How will you live?	
	
    And what's to come of my despised time	
	
    And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.'	
	
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,	
	
    And when in music we have spent an hour,	
	
    And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,	
	
    And when the work of generation was	
	
    And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave	
	
    And when we have our armours buckled on,	
	
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.	
	
    And where's our lesson, then? Boy, what say you?	
	
    And whiles I live t' account this world but hell,	
	
    And whiter than the paper it writ on	
	
    And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?	
	
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon	
	
    And will not be uplifted. But remember-	
	
    And will o'er reach them in their own devices,	
	
    And will to save the blood on either side,	
	
    And will with deeds requite thy gentleness;	
	
    And wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child;	
	
    And wish'd in silence that it were not his.	
	
    And with a care exempt themselves from fear:	
	
    And with a sudden re-enforcement struck	
	
    And with her personage, her tall personage,	
	
    And with hot irons must I burn them out.	
	
    And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,	
	
    And with our surfeiting and wanton hours	
	
    And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.	
	
    And with the other fling it at thy face,	
	
    And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded.	
	
    And with what zeal! For, now he has crack'd the league	
	
    And with your speediest bring us what she says,	
	
    And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,	
	
    And worms will not come to thee.	
	
    And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,	
	
    And wrangle with my reason, that persuades me	
	
    And write in thee the figures of their love,	
	
    And yet I am sure you are not satisfied	
	
    And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought-	
	
    And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?	
	
    And yet his trespass, in our common reason-	
	
    And yet no day without a deed to crown it.	
	
    And yet run'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;	
	
    And yet too good to be your concubine.	
	
    And yet we hear no tidings from the King;	
	
    And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come	
	
    And yet, to satisfy this good old man,	
	
    And you are dark'ned in this action, sir,	
	
    And you in love shall not deny me this.	
	
    And you shall find his vanities forespent	
	
    And you the mutinous members; for, examine	
	
    And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.	
	
    And you, Sir Walter Herbert-stay with me.	
	
    And younger hearings are quite ravished;	
	
    And yours of Helena to me bequeath,	
	
    And, Princes all, believe me, I beseech you,	
	
    And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband	
	
    And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give the	
	
    And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds	
	
    And, being angry, does forget that ever	
	
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,	
	
    And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number	
	
    And, countrymen, my loving followers,	
	
    And, for an entrance to my entertainment,	
	
    And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.	
	
    And, gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?	
	
    And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?	
	
    And, if you prove it, I'll repay it back	
	
    And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:	
	
    And, in the doing of the deed of kind,	
	
    And, like a man to double business bound,	
	
    And, like the watchful minutes to the hour,	
	
    And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace.	
	
    And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,	
	
    And, on a safer judgment, all revoke	
	
    And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.	
	
    And, till so much blood thither come again,	
	
    And, to conclude, we have 'greed so well together	
	
    And, toil'd with works of war, retir'd himself	
	
    And, which became him like a prince indeed,	
	
    And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!	
	
    And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.	
	
    Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.	
	
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;	
	
    Another of his fathom they have none	
	
    Another with his finger and his thumb	
	
    Answer mere nature- bid them flatter thee.	
	
    Answering the letter of the oracle,	
	
    Antony Woodville, her brother there,	
	
    Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,	
	
    Appear more wise and modest to the world.	
	
    Approacheth, to confer about some matter.	
	
    Are all thrown down; and that which here stands up	
	
    Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,	
	
    Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown.	
	
    Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?	
	
    Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispers'd, and fled.	
	
    Are in three heads: one power against the French,	
	
    Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,	
	
    Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.	
	
    Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,	
	
    Are natural breath; but, howsoe'er you have	
	
    Are now become enamour'd on his grave.	
	
    Are often welcomest when they are gone.	
	
    Are sent to Pomfret, and with them	
	
    Are sometimes, like our judgments, blind. Good faith,	
	
    Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought;	
	
    Are turned to one thread, one little hair;	
	
    Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed.	
	
    Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?	
	
    Are yours- my lord's. I give them with this ring,	
	
    Ariel and all his quality.	
	
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,	
	
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you	
	
    Art thou certain this is true? Is't most certain?	
	
    Art turn'd the greatest liar.	
	
    Arthur ta'en prisoner? Divers dear friends slain?	
	
    As 'twere a careless trifle.	
	
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.	
	
    As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear	
	
    As I am confident and kind to thee.	
	
    As I can change these poor accoutrements,	
	
    As I do love my father.	
	
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.	
	
    As I in duty love my king and country!	
	
    As I in justice and true right express it!	
	
    As I shall find the time to friend, I will.	
	
    As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad-	
	
    As Lewis himself. So, nobles, shall you all,	
	
    As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,	
	
    As aconitum or rash gunpowder.	
	
    As any she belied with false compare.	
	
    As are of better person than myself,	
	
    As bending angels; that's their fame in peace.	
	
    As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!	
	
    As bring me to the sight of Isabella,	
	
    As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!	
	
    As common bruit doth put it.	
	
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.	
	
    As does a Britain peasant. So I'll fight	
	
    As doth the raven o'er the infected house,	
	
    As e'er I heard in madness.	
	
    As enemy to the people and his country.	
	
    As far as to the sepulchre of Christ-	
	
    As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,	
	
    As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,	
	
    As for my country I have shed my blood,	
	
    As friendly as you were.	
	
    As frozen water to a starved snake.	
	
    As give a crutch to th' dead. But our Count-Cardinal	
	
    As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.	
	
    As hating thee, are rising up in arms;	
	
    As he is but my father's brother's son,	
	
    As he is very potent with such spirits,	
	
    As he will have me, how am I so poor?	
	
    As here at home, suggests the King our master	
	
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid	
	
    As huge as high Olympus.	
	
    As if a double hunt were heard at once,	
	
    As if he had but prov'd an argument.	
	
    As if his life lay on 't.	
	
    As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,	
	
    As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain	
	
    As if we should forget we had no hands,	
	
    As in good time he may- from Ireland coming,	
	
    As index to the story we late talk'd of,	
	
    As is the other for beauteous modesty.	
	
    As it is common for the younger sort	
	
    As it may lose some color.	
	
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.	
	
    As like almost to Claudio as himself.    [Unmuffles CLAUDIO]	
	
    As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.	
	
    As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall	
	
    As makes the angels weep; who, with our speens,	
	
    As may beseem a monarch like himself.	
	
    As might hold sortance with his quality,	
	
    As much as I deserve? Why, that's the lady!	
	
    As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.	
	
    As my mother was, the first hour I was born.	
	
    As next the King he was successive heir-	
	
    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.	
	
    As once to our mother; use like note and words,	
	
    As others would ambitiously receive it.	
	
    As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;	
	
    As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,	
	
    As punishment for his most wicked life.          Exeunt some	
	
    As seek to soften that- than which what's harder?-	
	
    As she in beauty, education, blood,	
	
    As slept within the shadow of your power,	
	
    As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.	
	
    As sure I think did never man love so,	
	
    As that which causeth it. How can I moderate it?	
	
    As the free elements. And then for her	
	
    As the weird women promised, and I fear	
	
    As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,	
	
    As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon,	
	
    As this Gonzalo; I myself could make	
	
    As those that I am come to tell you of!	
	
    As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,	
	
    As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.	
	
    As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.	
	
    As till that time I shall not pity thee.	
	
    As to expend your time with us awhile	
	
    As to upbraid you with those kindnesses	
	
    As too triumphing, how mine enemies	
	
    As two spent swimmers that do cling together	
	
    As we are now glad to behold your eyes-	
	
    As we his subjects have in wonder found,	
	
    As we with honour and respect may take,	
	
    As well as speak- it tauntingly replied	
	
    As well we may, if not through your neglect-	
	
    As when his virtues shining upon others	
	
    As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'	
	
    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?	
	
    As words to little purpose.	
	
    As would- but that they dare not- take our parts.	
	
    As you did love, but as you fear'd him.	
	
    As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her;	
	
    As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit	
	
    As you would beg were you in my distress.	
	
    As, an't please heaven, he shall not -they should find	
	
    As, to seek through the regions of the earth	
	
    Assays to lead the way. If I once stir,	
	
    Assisted by that most disloyal traitor	
	
    At Christmas I no more desire a rose	
	
    At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,	
	
    At ample point all that I did possess	
	
    At chamber door? and one as great as you are?	
	
    At large discoursed in this paper here.	
	
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,	
	
    At many times I brought in my accounts,	
	
    At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;	
	
    At such a time, with all the rest retold,	
	
    At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,	
	
    At what it did so freely? From this time	
	
    At your industrious scenes and acts of death.	
	
    Attend him here this morning.	
	
    Attendants.	
	
    Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,	
	
    Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal.	
	
    Awake, awake!	
	
    Awakes me all the enrolled penalties	
	
    Away with him!	
	
    Away, Patroclus!                              Exit with PATROCLUS	
	
    Away, and glister like the god of war	
	
    Ay me! What is this world! What news are these!	
	
    Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,	
	
    Ay, marry, will we, sir! and we'll be waited on.	
	
    Ay, there, look grim as hell!	
	
    Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly;	
	
    Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,	
	
    Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,	
	
    Bardolph! Peto! I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An	
	
    Barnardine!	
	
    Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;	
	
    Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,	
	
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.	
	
    Be bounteous at our meal.	
	
    Be call'd Posthumus Leonatus, and	
	
    Be closed in our household's monument.	
	
    Be executed by nine to-morrow morning;	
	
    Be gone, I say; for till you do return	
	
    Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors.	
	
    Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.	
	
    Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure	
	
    Be measur'd or confin'd.	
	
    Be noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian!	
	
    Be not dismay'd, for succour is at hand.	
	
    Be not thyself-for how art thou a king	
	
    Be now as prodigal of all dear grace	
	
    Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn Queen.	
	
    Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,	
	
    Be round impaled with a glorious crown.	
	
    Be soon collected, and all things thought upon	
	
    Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;	
	
    Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, the carpets	
	
    Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at,	
	
    Be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment.	
	
    Be villainy less than 'twas! O Imogen!	
	
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;	
	
    Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence	
	
    Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;	
	
    Bearing the King's will from his mouth expressly?	
	
    Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,	
	
    Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,	
	
    Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,	
	
    Because I love you, I will let you know.	
	
    Because he is Protector of the realm,	
	
    Because his purpose is not executed.	
	
    Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste.	
	
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.	
	
    Because we see it; but what we do not see	
	
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.	
	
    Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon	
	
    Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,	
	
    Been justled from your senses, know for certain	
	
    Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:	
	
    Before I speak, too threat'ningly replies.	
	
    Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,	
	
    Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!	
	
    Before so noble and so great a figure	
	
    Before the eye and prospect of your town,	
	
    Before this outdar'd dastard? Ere my tongue	
	
    Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!	
	
    Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,	
	
    Before you serve.	
	
    Began a fresh assault.	
	
    Beguil'd all spies.	
	
    Beguiling them of commendation.	
	
    Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,	
	
    Behold, as may unworthiness define,	
	
    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,	
	
    Being but the second generation	
	
    Being create for comfort, to be us'd	
	
    Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;	
	
    Being nothing like the noble Duke my father.	
	
    Being once gangren'd, is not then respected	
	
    Being sick, have in some measure made me well;	
	
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.	
	
    Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.	
	
    Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd.	
	
    Believe't, my lord and I have made an end:	
	
    Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:	
	
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;	
	
    Besides himself, are all the English peers,	
	
    Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say	
	
    Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed,	
	
    Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,	
	
    Best half of our affair.	
	
    Better be held nor more attain'd than by	
	
    Better once than never, for never too late.           Exeunt	
	
    Between his greatness and thy other brethren.	
	
    Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,	
	
    Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,	
	
    Betwixt my love and your high majesty.	
	
    Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.	
	
    Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-	
	
    Beyond you to your friends.	
	
    Bianca's grief.	
	
    Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed	
	
    Bid'st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish;	
	
    Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not	
	
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me	
	
    Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed	
	
    Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek	
	
    Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,	
	
    Bold of your worthiness, we single you	
	
    Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds.	
	
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.	
	
    Both he, and they, and you, yea, every man	
	
    Both merits pois'd, each weighs nor less nor more;	
	
    Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,	
	
    Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,	
	
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,	
	
    Boyet, you can produce acquittances	
	
    Brave son, derived from honorable loins!	
	
    Break up this capon.

    Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,	
	
    Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,	
	
    Bring me the fairest creature northward born,	
	
    Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin'd speed	
	
    Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;	
	
    Brook; Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.            Exit	
	
    Brought my too diligent ear; for several virtues	
	
    Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;	
	
    Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee.	
	
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.	
	
    Bury him where you can, he comes not here.	
	
    But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.	
	
    But Brutus says he was ambitious,	
	
    But God in mercy so deal with my soul	
	
    But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,	
	
    But I did find him still mine enemy.	
	
    But I in danger for the breach of law.	
	
    But I must make fair weather yet awhile,	
	
    But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.	
	
    But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;	
	
    But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve	
	
    But I'll deceive you in another sort,	
	
    But I-that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,	
	
    But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,	
	
    But Tuesday night last gone, in's garden-house,	
	
    But am in that dimension grossly clad	
	
    But art thou not drown'd, Stephano? I hope now thou are	
	
    But as we stand in fear-	
	
    But be the serpent under it. He that's coming	
	
    But being so allow'd. To apprehend thus	
	
    But by contempt of nature.	
	
    But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,	
	
    But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?	
	
    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger	
	
    But come, young waverer, come go with me.	
	
    But cruel are the times when we are traitors	
	
    But dies betray'd to fortune by your strife.	
	
    But do not look for further recompense	
	
    But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,	
	
    But even the mere necessities upon't.	
	
    But every rub is smoothed on our way.	
	
    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next	
	
    But first I will release the Fairy Queen.	
	
    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,	
	
    But for my brother not a man would speak;	
	
    But for you, rebels- look to taste the due	
	
    But from Lord Angelo by special charge.	
	
    But from this lady may proceed a gem	
	
    But graciously to know I am no better.	
	
    But had his titles by Tenantius, whom	
	
    But he fell to himself again, and sweetly	
	
    But he would bite none; just as I do now,	
	
    But heavenly Rosalind!                                  Exit	
	
    But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;	
	
    But honour thee, and will do till I die.	
	
    But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees	
	
    But if it be a sin to covet honour,	
	
    But if there be nor ever were one such,	
	
    But if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,	
	
    But if you have a stomach, to't a God's name;	
	
    But in his motion like an angel sings,	
	
    But in ourselves that we are underlings.	
	
    But in the midst of this bright-shining day	
	
    But is there no quick recreation granted?	
	
    But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,	
	
    But keep a farm and carters.	
	
    But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,	
	
    But lend and give where she is sure to lose;	
	
    But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,	
	
    But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-	
	
    But life itself, my wife, and all the world,	
	
    But like a man he died.	
	
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.	
	
    But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,	
	
    But many a many foot of land the worse.	
	
    But meet him now and be it in the morn,	
	
    But mine is made the prologue to their play;	
	
    But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,	
	
    But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.	
	
    But never hope to know why I should marry her.	
	
    But not another sin upon my head	
	
    But not so citizen a wanton as	
	
    But now I am past all comforts here, but prayers.	
	
    But now I see our lances are but straws,	
	
    But now mischance hath trod my title down	
	
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-	
	
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their

    But par'd my present havings to bestow	
	
    But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.	
	
    But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,	
	
    But say I could not help it.	
	
    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.	
	
    But shall we wear these glories for a day;	
	
    But shift away. There's warrant in that theft	
	
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.	
	
    But so it is- my haste doth call me hence,	
	
    But speak, Egeus; is not this the day	
	
    But stay the very riping of the time;	
	
    But such a headstrong potent fault it is	
	
    But suck them up to th' top-mast. A kind of conquest	
	
    But tell not me; I know Antonio	
	
    But that I know love is begun by time,	
	
    But that between us we can kill a fly	
	
    But that her flight prevented it, she had	
	
    But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!	
	
    But that the dread of something after death-	
	
    But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd	
	
    But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.	
	
    But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds	
	
    But the protractive trials of great Jove	
	
    But then more 'why?'-why have they dar'd to march	
	
    But there's but one in all doth hold his place.	
	
    But they must blab-	
	
    But this eternal blazon must not be	
	
    But this thing dare not-	
	
    But this, which they produce from Pharamond:	
	
    But thou mistakes me much to think I do.	
	
    But thoughts the slave, of life, and life time's fool,	
	
    But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.	
	
    But to confirm my curses. Could I meet 'em	
	
    But to know so must be my benefit;	
	
    But to the earth some special good doth give;	
	
    But truly I do fear it.	
	
    But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings,	
	
    But we will plant some other in the throne	
	
    But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.	
	
    But what at full I know, thou know'st no part;	
	
    But what see what see I? No Thisby do I see.	
	
    But what thou art besides, thou wert too base	
	
    But when contention and occasion meet,	
	
    But when he once attains the upmost round,	
	
    But when your countenance filled up his line,	
	
    But where one villain is, then him abandon.-	
	
    But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?	
	
    But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?	
	
    But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;	
	
    But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.	
	
    But with an angry waiter of your hand	
	
    But with as humble lowliness of mind	
	
    But words are words; I never yet did hear	
	
    But would it please thee, good Andronicus,	
	
    But yet come not. You are a tame man; go!	
	
    But yield me to the veriest hind that shall

    But, being season'd with a gracious voice,	
	
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;	
	
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,

    By God, he shall not have a Scot of them!

    By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self.	
	
    By deed-achieving honour newly nam'd-	
	
    By doing deeds of hospitality.	
	
    By favours several which they did bestow.	
	
    By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.	
	
    By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours.	
	
    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,

    By reason of his absence, there is nothing	
	
    By self-example mayst thou be denied.

    Caesar himself has work, and our oppression	
	
    Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you	
	
    Caesar, that hath moe kings his servants than	
	
    Call forth the holy father.                Exit an ATTENDANT	
	
    Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought	
	
    Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!	
	
    Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts	
	
    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;	
	
    Came here to make us merry! And thou hast kill'd him.	
	
    Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,	
	
    Came to the bar; where to his accusations	
	
    Can chase away the first conceived sound?	
	
    Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?	
	
    Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'	
	
    Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?	
	
    Can ransom me into his love again,	
	
    Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.	
	
    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;	
	
    Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,	
	
    Cannot attain it, why then-hark you hither.	
	
    Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,	
	
    Cannot make better note.	
	
    Canst thou believe thy living is a life,	
	
    Cap'ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,	
	
    Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;	
	
    Carry his honours even. Whether 'twas pride,	
	
    Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own	
	
    Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,

    Change shapes with Protheus for advantages,	
	
    Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France;	
	
    Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance;	
	
    Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,	
	
    Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should	
	
    Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;	
	
    Civil dissension is a viperous worm	
	
    Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,	
	
    Claudio!	
	
    Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.	
	
    Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close;	
	
    Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.	
	
    Cold statues of the youth; and, in a word,	
	
    Com'st thou again for ransom?	
	
    Come away, servant; come; I am ready now.	
	
    Come hither, Harry; sit thou by my bed,	
	
    Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford, the honest

    Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;	
	
    Come when the King doth to my lady come;	
	
    Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour	
	
    Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.	
	
    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!	
	
    Come, come, be every one officious	
	
    Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep	
	
    Come, down into the boat.	
	
    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.	
	
    Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.	
	
    Come, let us take a muster speedily.	
	
    Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed	
	
    Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast	
	
    Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:	
	
    Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends

    Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,	
	
    Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eggs,	
	
    Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,	
	
    Command these fretting waters from your eyes	
	
    Commend me to my brother; soon at night	
	
    Commend me to your honourable wife;	
	
    Commit myself, my person, and the cause.	
	
    Commotions, uproars, with a general taint	
	
    Comprising all that may be sworn or said,	
	
    Condemn'd upon the act of fornication	
	
    Condemning shadows quite.	
	
    Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,	
	
    Confound them by some course, and come to me,	
	
    Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;	
	
    Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,	
	
    Consider who the King your father sends,	
	
    Consort with me in loud and dear petition,	
	
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.	
	
    Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,	
	
    Contriv'd by art and baleful sorcery.

    Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:	
	
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)	
	
    Could not so mope.	
	
    Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;	
	
    Counting myself but bad till I be best.	
	
    Courageously and with a free desire	
	
    Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,	
	
    Covering discretion with a coat of folly;	
	
    Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.-	
	
    Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night	
	
    Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus; I	
	
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot	
	
    Crown him, and say 'Long live our Emperor!'	
	
    Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,	
	
    Cry 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,	
	
    Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.	
	
    Curbing his lavish spirit; and, to conclude,	
	
    Curs'd be I that did so! All the charms	
	
    Cut off the sequence of posterity,	
	
    Cuts off so many years of fearing death.	
	
    Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,

    Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.	
	
    Daunt all your hopes. Madam, he comforts you	
	
    Daylight and champain discovers not more. This is open. I will be	
	
    Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb	
	
    Dear my lord, pardon! I dare not,	
	
    Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels;	
	
    Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;	
	
    Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?	
	
    Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,	
	
    Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.	
	
    Deliver all with charity.	
	
    Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,	
	
    Demand the like.	
	
    Depart again. Here, here will I remain	
	
    Depriv'd of honour and inheritance.	
	
    Derived from the ancient Capilet.	
	
    Deserve we no more reverence?	
	
    Deserves a corner. Would all other women	
	
    Desires to be admitted to your presence.	
	
    Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,	
	
    Destroy what lies before 'em.	
	
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!	
	
    Devesting them for bed; and then, but now	
	
    Devour up my discourse; which I observing,	
	
    Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!	
	
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they	
	
    Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw	
	
    Did ever in so true a flame of liking	
	
    Did follow to his um.	
	
    Did he suspire, that light and weightless down	
	
    Did keep ten thousand men? Was this the face	
	
    Did need an oath; when every drop of blood	
	
    Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts	
	
    Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,	
	
    Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,	
	
    Did speak these words, now prov'd a prophecy?	
	
    Did us but loving wrong.	
	
    Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?	
	
    Did you not use his daughter very friendly?	
	
    Didst ever hear a man so penitent?	
	
    Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:	
	
    Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,	
	
    Directly int'rest; mark what Jacob did:	
	
    Disclaiming here the kindred of the King;	
	
    Discover where thy mistress is at once,	
	
    Disfigure not his slop.	
	
    Disguise us at my lodging, and return	
	
    Disorder, horror, fear, and mutiny,	
	
    Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them	
	
    Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,	
	
    Ditch?	
	
    Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,	
	
    Do I shrink up.	
	
    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.	
	
    Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,	
	
    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is	
	
    Do hiss me into madness.	
	
    Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.	
	
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;	
	
    Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.	
	
    Do or undo, as if ourself were here.	
	
    Do pelt so fast at one another's pate	
	
    Do thine own fortunes that obedient right	
	
    Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'	
	
    Do villainy, do, since you protest to do't,	
	
    Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees,	
	
    Do you love me, master? No?	
	
    Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers,	
	
    Does conquer him that did his master conquer,	
	
    Does pity, as constrained blemishes,	
	
    Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled	
	
    Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,	
	
    Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,	
	
    Dost thou here lie!	
	
    Dost thou not see my baby at my breast	
	
    Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?	
	
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.	
	
    Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse,	
	
    Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent	
	
    Doth play the trumpet to his purposes	
	
    Doth teach me answers for deliverance!	
	
    Doublets, I think-flew up, and had their faces	
	
    Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither-	
	
    Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;	
	
    Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,	
	
    Draws us a profit from all things we see,	
	
    Drink the free air.	
	
    Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother.	
	
    Drove back again unto my native clime?	
	
    Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.	
	
    Duke of Gloucester	
	
    Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn'd for	
	
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!	
	
    Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,

    Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.	
	
    Each one, tripping on his toe,	
	
    Early and late, debating to and fro	
	
    Eating the bitter bread of banishment,	
	
    Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.	
	
    Effect it with some care, that he may prove	
	
    Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which	
	
    Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice	
	
    Either in hope or present, I'd exchange	
	
    Either past or not arriv'd to pith and puissance;	
	
    Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,	
	
    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,	
	
    Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet	
	
    Emilia, run you to the citadel,	
	
    Encounter such revolt.	
	
    Endure the winter's cold as well as he.	
	
    Enforc'd us to this execution?	
	
    England and France might through their amity	
	
    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,	
	
    English- Canst thou love me?	
	
    Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,	
	
    Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,	
	
    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing	
	
    Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;	
	
    Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,	
	
    Envelop you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?	
	
    Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,	
	
    Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant.	
	
    Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;	
	
    Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! What, Troilus!	
	
    Ere thou relieve the beggar. Give to dogs	
	
    Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!	
	
    Especially for those occasions	
	
    Ev'n to the Hall, to hear what shall become	
	
    Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!	
	
    Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts	
	
    Even for the loss of thee, having no more,	
	
    Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,	
	
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,	
	
    Even in the lusty haviour of his son.	
	
    Even in these honest mean habiliments;	
	
    Even of your metal, of your very blood;	
	
    Even so it was with me when I was young.	
	
    Even so suspicious is this tragedy.	
	
    Even till that England, hedg'd in with the main,	
	
    Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,	
	
    Even to the dullest peasant in his camp-	
	
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,	
	
    Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,	
	
    Ever in France shall be kept festival.	
	
    Every good servant does not all commands;	
	
    Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,	
	
    Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,	
	
    Except a sword or sceptre balance it.	
	
    Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey.	
	
    Execute all things; for no kind of traffic	
	
    Expect your Highness' doom of life or death.	
	
    Expos'd unto the sea, which hath requit it,	
	
    Eye of newt and toe of frog,	
	
    FLAVIUS, steward to Timon	
	
    Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.                Exeunt	
	
    Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.	
	
    Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;	
	
    Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,	
	
    Falling on Diomed.	
	
    False blood to false blood join'd! Gone to be friends!	
	
    Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his horns,	
	
    Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!	
	
    Farewell nobility! Let his Grace go forward	
	
    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!	
	
    Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet	
	
    Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone.	
	
    Farewell.	
	
    Farewell;	
	
    Father of Warwick, know you what this means?	
	
    Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,	
	
    Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?	
	
    Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.	
	
    Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,	
	
    Fell from their boughs, and left me open, bare	
	
    Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,	
	
    Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine	
	
    Fie, fie, fie, fie!	
	
    Fight closer or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.	
	
    Figures pedantical- these summer-flies	
	
    Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts,	
	
    Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail;	
	
    Find written in the margent of his eyes,	
	
    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.	
	
    First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw.	
	
    First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling,	
	
    First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,	
	
    Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,	
	
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,	
	
    Flatt'ring himself in project of a power	
	
    Flourish.                                             Exeunt	
	
    Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,	
	
    Foh, one may smell in such a will most rank,	
	
    Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.	
	
    Followed thy heels.	
	
    Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,	
	
    For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,	
	
    For Anjou, and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,	
	
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,	
	
    For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.	
	
    For God sake, let not us two stay at home;	
	
    For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes	
	
    For I am on the sudden something ill.	
	
    For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.	
	
    For I am sure, when he shall see our army,	
	
    For I dare so far free him- made him fear'd,	
	
    For I have bills for money by exchange	
	
    For I have only been silent so long,	
	
    For I must ever doubt though ne'er so sure,	
	
    For I myself must hunt this deer to death.	
	
    For I profess not talking. Only this-	
	
    For I will make him tell the tale anew,	
	
    For I would commune with you of such things	
	
    For Queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;	
	
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.	
	
    For a short holding. If we lose the field	
	
    For all her cherubin look.	
	
    For all this spice of your hypocrisy.	
	
    For as I am, I live upon the rack.	
	
    For aye thy foot-licker.	
	
    For being now a favourer to the Briton,	
	
    For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;	
	
    For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie	
	
    For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,	
	
    For competence of life I will allow you,	
	
    For doing these fair rites of tenderness.	
	
    For emulation hath a thousand sons	
	
    For ere the six years that he hath to spend	
	
    For every false drop in her bawdy veins	
	
    For fair without the fair within to hide.	
	
    For fear of that I still will stay with thee	
	
    For folly that he wisely shows is fit;	
	
    For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite	
	
    For grief is proud, and makes his owner stoop.	
	
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,	
	
    For he hath heard of our confederacy,	
	
    For he is set so only to himself	
	
    For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,	
	
    For her poor brother's pardon.	
	
    For here the Troyans taste our dear'st repute	
	
    For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all	
	
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,	
	
    For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers,	
	
    For idleness itself.	
	
    For in a night the best part of my pow'r,	
	
    For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar-	
	
    For interim to our studies shall relate,	
	
    For it is thine.	
	
    For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,	
	
    For living idly here in pomp and ease,	
	
    For loving where you do; but if yourself,	
	
    For many weary months.	
	
    For me, by heaven, I bid you be assur'd,	
	
    For more is to be said and to be done	
	
    For my affection.	
	
    For my profession's sacred from above.	
	
    For nature crescent does not grow alone	
	
    For night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing.	
	
    For not bestowing on him at his asking	
	
    For nothing canst thou to damnation add	
	
    For often with a solemn earnestness,	
	
    For on that ground I'll make a holy descant;	
	
    For our affairs in hand. If that come short,	
	
    For patience she will prove a second Grissel,	
	
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let	
	
    For private stomaching.	
	
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,	
	
    For she commanding all, obey'd of none.	
	
    For since the Cardinal fell that title's lost.	
	
    For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;	
	
    For so they seem. Th' have left their barge and landed,	
	
    For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?	
	
    For stale to catch these thieves.	
	
    For such a one we show'd 'em. If they smile	
	
    For such proceeding I am charged withal-	
	
    For sure there's no converting 'em. Now	
	
    For testimony of her foul proceedings.	
	
    For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;	
	
    For that my sovereign liege was in my debt	
	
    For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.        Exit PROVOST	
	
    For the contempt of empire.	
	
    For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,	
	
    For the only she; and- pauca, there's enough.	
	
    For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life	
	
    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long	
	
    For then this land was famously enrich'd	
	
    For these two heads do seem to speak to me,	
	
    For they have grudged us contribution.	
	
    For they must all be mask'd and vizarded-	
	
    For this immediate levy, he commands	
	
    For this is he that moves both wind and tide.	
	
    For this will out, and then I must not stay.            Exit	
	
    For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.	
	
    For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty.	
	
    For though my soul disputes well with my sense	
	
    For through this laund anon the deer will come;	
	
    For thy great bounty, that not only giv'st	
	
    For till thou speak thou shalt not pass from hence.	
	
    For truth to o'erpeer. Rather than fool it so,	
	
    For valiant doings in their country's cause?	
	
    For we are soft as our complexions are,	
	
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,	
	
    For well I know he was unnatural.	
	
    For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?	
	
    For what his eyes eat only.	
	
    For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.	
	
    For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,	
	
    For which the pardoner himself is in;	
	
    For whilst I think I am thy married wife	
	
    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.	
	
    For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;	
	
    For yet is hope of life and victory.	
	
    For you shall hence upon your wedding day.	
	
    For you'll prove perjur'd if you make me stay.	
	
    For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.	
	
    For's private friends; his answer to me was,	
	
    For, as I think, they do command him home,	
	
    For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,	
	
    For, hearing this, I must perforce compound	
	
    For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.	
	
    For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.	
	
    Forbid the smiling courtesy of love	
	
    Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompass'd you? Go to;	
	
    Ford, that search'd a hollow walnut for his wife's leman.'	
	
    Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.	
	
    Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,	
	
    Forgiveness, horse! Why do I rail on thee,	
	
    Form such another? This is the very top,	
	
    Fortune and Antony part here; even here	
	
    Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.	
	
    Foul subornation is predominant,	
	
    Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about	
	
    France should have torn and rent my very heart	
	
    France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,	
	
    Fraught with the ministers and instruments	
	
    French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.	
	
    Fresher than e'er it was, and held for certain

    From France?	
	
    From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.	
	
    From all direction, purpose, course, intent-	
	
    From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;	
	
    From fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate	
	
    From flow'ry tenderness? If I must die,	
	
    From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;	
	
    From his most fam'd of famous ancestors,	
	
    From me do back receive the flour of all,	
	
    From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,	
	
    From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.	
	
    From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.	
	
    From out the fiery portal of the east,	
	
    From some forefather grief; mine is not so,	
	
    From th' noise of our own drums.'	
	
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,	
	
    From the most gracious regent of this land,	
	
    From these that my poor company detest.	
	
    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!	
	
    From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.	
	
    From what it purpos'd; since to wail friends lost	
	
    From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest	
	
    From whom we thought it meet to hide our love	
	
    From women's eyes this doctrine I derive.	
	
    Full of crusadoes; and, but my noble Moor	
	
    Full of the pasture, jumps along by him

    Further to boast were neither true nor modest,	
	
    Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame	
	
    Garter.	
	
    Gave it a judge's clerk! No, God's my judge,	
	
    Gentlemen all- alas, what shall I say?	
	
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.	
	
    Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.            Exeunt	
	
    Give him a little earth for charity!'	
	
    Give him the cup.	
	
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.	
	
    Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There,	
	
    Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary	
	
    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,	
	
    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.	
	
    Give me your hand; come you from old Bellario?	
	
    Give order to my servants that they take	
	
    Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.	
	
    Give up your keys.	
	
    Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,	
	
    Given private time to you, and you yourself	
	
    Gives way to in repose!	
	
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be	
	
    Glittering in golden coats like images;	
	
    Go after him; for he perhaps shall need	
	
    Go forth and fetch their conqu'ring Caesar in;	
	
    Go know of Cassio where he supp'd tonight.	
	
    Go presently inquire, and so will I,	
	
    Go speedily, and bring again the Count.	
	
    Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,	
	
    Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand;	
	
    Go to.	
	
    Go with me to my tent, where you shall see	
	
    Go, bid her hide him quickly from the Duke.	
	
    Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.	
	
    Go, get thee gone, I say.	
	
    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;	
	
    God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!           Exeunt	
	
    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay	
	
    God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee!	
	
    God on my knees thou mayst be turn'd to hobnails. [Here they	
	
    God save you, Signior Gremio!	
	
    God shield us!- a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing; for	
	
    God will revenge it; whom I will importune	
	
    Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,	
	
    Gone slightly o'er low steps, and now are mounted	
	
    Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!	
	
    Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.	
	
    Good ancestors.	
	
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge	
	
    Good lords, although my will to give is living,	
	
    Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,	
	
    Good night, mother.	
	
    Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,	
	
    Goodness and he fill up one monument!	
	
    Govern'd a wolf who, hang'd for human slaughter,

    Great Earl of Washford, Waterford, and Valence,	
	
    Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin;	
	
    Great men may jest with saints: 'tis wit in them;	
	
    Grew a companion to the common streets,	
	
    Grievous-complaints of you; which, being consider'd,	
	
    Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,	
	
    Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.	
	
    Guess thou the rest: King Edward's friends must down.	
	
    Ha!	
	
    Had I expected thee.	
	
    Had I so lavish of my presence been,	
	
    Had been the Regent there instead of me,	
	
    Had grac'd the tender temples of my child;	
	
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart	
	
    Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,	
	
    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.	
	
    Had the full view of, such a noise arose	
	
    Had twenty years been made. This is a stern

    Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armor.	
	
    Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit	
	
    Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?	
	
    Hark further.	
	
    Hark, Polydore, it sounds. But what occasion	
	
    Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.	
	
    Harry the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity:	
	
    Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home	
	
    Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,	
	
    Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?	
	
    Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,	
	
    Haste there before us. I constantly believe-	
	
    Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!	
	
    Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with	
	
    Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,	
	
    Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,	
	
    Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.	
	
    Hath every pelting river made so proud	
	
    Hath from the number of his banish'd years	
	
    Hath he conversed with the enemy,	
	
    Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,	
	
    Hath kept with thy remembrance?	
	
    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.	
	
    Hath married the fair lady.	
	
    Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to	
	
    Hath not her fellow.	
	
    Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas	
	
    Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;	
	
    Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance	
	
    Hath she forgot already that brave prince,	
	
    Hath suffered under praise.	
	
    Hath thus stood for his country. Therefore please you,	
	
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,	
	
    Hath yielded up his body to the grave;	
	
    Have I been ever free, and must my house	
	
    Have I heard groan and drop. Then know me not.	
	
    Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?	
	
    Have all lim'd bushes to betray thy wings,	
	
    Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;	
	
    Have blown me full of maggot ostentation.	
	
    Have burnt that tongue than said so.	
	
    Have by my hands of life bereaved him.	
	
    Have done to this.	
	
    Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully;	
	
    Have got by the late voyage is but merely	
	
    Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,	
	
    Have letters from me to some friends that will	
	
    Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick	
	
    Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.	
	
    Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point,	
	
    Have other some. Why, 'tis a happy thing	
	
    Have seal'd thy full desire.	
	
    Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,	
	
    Have the patricians of you. For your wants,	
	
    Have thus proceeded.	
	
    Have to my widow; and if she be froward,	
	
    Have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride!	
	
    Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.	
	
    Have with our needles created both one flower,	
	
    Have you not set them on?	
	
    Having all day carous'd and banqueted;	
	
    Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.	
	
    Having the fearful flying hare in sight,	
	
    He answers:	
	
    He being of age to govern of himself?	
	
    He bow'd his nature, never known before	
	
    He can at pleasure stint their melody;	
	
    He cannot live, I hope, and must not die	
	
    He could not stay to pick them in a pile	
	
    He did entreat me, past all saying nay,	
	
    He did it with a serious mind; a heed	
	
    He does it under name of perfect love;	
	
    He falls to such perusal of my face	
	
    He first presents his fire, and the high east	
	
    He goes away in a cloud. Call him, call him.	
	
    He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;	
	
    He has done my office. I know not if't be true,	
	
    He hath against himself.	
	
    He hath commanded me to go to bed,	
	
    He hath whipt with rods; dares me to personal combat,	
	
    He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,	
	
    He is a very serpent in my way;	
	
    He is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours	
	
    He is retir'd, to ripe his growing fortunes,	
	
    He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,	
	
    He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh	
	
    He lessens his requests and to thee sues	
	
    He lov'd me-O false wench!-Give't me again.	
	
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.	
	
    He may surrender; so we shall proceed	
	
    He must not be my brother.	
	
    He needs must see himself.	
	
    He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.	
	
    He presently become a Christian;	
	
    He rather means to lodge you in the field,	
	
    He says, to veil full purpose.	
	
    He sent in writing after me; what he would not,	
	
    He shall be executed presently.              Exeunt SENATORS	
	
    He shall in strangeness stand no farther off	
	
    He shortens four years of my son's exile;	
	
    He should, or he should not; for he made me mad	
	
    He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.	
	
    He takes false shadows for true substances.	
	
    He that is truly dedicate to war	
	
    He that meets Hector issues from our choice;	
	
    He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,	
	
    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;	
	
    He was a gentleman on whom I built	
	
    He was not sad, for he would shine on those	
	
    He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,	
	
    He will again be well. If much you note him,	
	
    He will remain so.	
	
    He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,	
	
    He writes me here that inward sickness-	
	
    He'd lay the future open. You good gods,	
	
    He'll tell me all his purpose. Sure, he'll come.	
	
    He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat	
	
    He's loving and most gracious. 'Twill be much	
	
    He's strange and peevish.	
	
    Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.	
	
    Hear a foot fall; we now are near his cell.	
	
    Hear patiently my purpose. I'll disrobe me	
	
    Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?	
	
    Hearing us praise our loves of Italy	
	
    Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,	
	
    Heaven is above all yet: there sits a Judge	
	
    Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!	
	
    Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate,	
	
    Hector, in view of Troyans and of Greeks,	
	
    Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles of	
	
    Help Salisbury to make his testament.	
	
    Hence hath offence his quick celerity,	
	
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,	
	
    Henceforth be never numb'red among men!	
	
    Henry is able to enrich his queen,	
	
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all	
	
    Her beauty, and the value of her dower,	
	
    Her brother is in secret come from France;	
	
    Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,	
	
    Her father is no better than an earl,	
	
    Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her	
	
    Her infinite cunning with her modern grace	
	
    Her motion and her station are as one;	
	
    Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.	
	
    Her sister Katherine welcome'd you withal?	
	
    Her very silence and her patience,	
	
    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;	
	
    Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words	
	
    Here come I from our princely general	
	
    Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.	
	
    Here comes his mother.	
	
    Here could I breathe my soul into the air,	
	
    Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,	
	
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,	
	
    Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice;	
	
    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt	
	
    Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad	
	
    Here let us breathe, and haply institute	
	
    Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,	
	
    Here sheathe thy sword; I'll pardon thee my death.	
	
    Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?	
	
    Here will I rest me till the break of day.	
	
    Here's goodly work!	
	
    Here's to thy health.	
	
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,	
	
    Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-	
	
    Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!	
	
    Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.	
	
    Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile,	
	
    High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.	
	
    Him that thou magnifi'st with all these tides,	
	
    Himself a king.	
	
    His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,	
	
    His accusations.	
	
    His baseness that ensued?	
	
    His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;	
	
    His brother's death at Bristow, the Lord Scroop.	
	
    His champions are the prophets and apostles;	
	
    His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.	
	
    His crest, that prouder than blue Iris bends.	
	
    His death was so effected. Better 'twere	
	
    His eye-balls further out than when he liv'd,	
	
    His faults lie open to the laws; let them,	
	
    His folly to the mettle of my speech?	
	
    His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name	
	
    His glorious deeds for my indignities.	
	
    His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd	
	
    His honour. O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!	
	
    His jest will savour but of shallow wit,	
	
    His liberty is full of threats to all-	
	
    His loving bosom, to keep down his heart.	
	
    His mistress' picture; which by his tongue being made,	
	
    His mother was a vot'ress of my order;	
	
    His pardon for return.	
	
    His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,	
	
    His present and your pains we thank you for.	
	
    His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,	
	
    His second marriage shall be publish'd, and	
	
    His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march;	
	
    His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,	
	
    His taken labours bid him me forgive;	
	
    His time doth take.	
	
    His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,	
	
    His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;	
	
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide	
	
    Hoists sails and flies.	
	
    Hold me your loyal servant.	
	
    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!	
	
    Hold, therefore, Angelo-	
	
    Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.	
	
    Honour and plenteous safety-that you read	
	
    Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment	
	
    Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.	
	
    Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,	
	
    How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,	
	
    How I did thrive in this fair lady's love	
	
    How I shall take her from her father's house;	
	
    How are we park'd and bounded in a pale	
	
    How chance the roses there do fade so fast?	
	
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!	
	
    How does his Highness?	
	
    How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?	
	
    How easily murder is discovered!	
	
    How everything is chanced.                           Exeunt.	
	
    How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?	
	
    How goes the world, sir, now?	
	
    How happy then were my ensuing death!	
	
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,	
	
    How insolent of late he is become,	
	
    How it goes with us, and do look to know	
	
    How long her face is drawn! How pale she looks,	
	
    How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak.	
	
    How many then should cover that stand bare!	
	
    How many years a mortal man may live.	
	
    How much in duty I am bound to both.	
	
    How near the tidings of our comfort is.	
	
    How now! what news?	
	
    How now, Malvolio!	
	
    How now, Thersites! What's the matter, man?	
	
    How now, my brother!	
	
    How now, who's there?	
	
    How now, young man! Mean'st thou to fight to-day?	
	
    How often hast thou waited at my cup,	
	
    How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,	
	
    How shall we do for money for these wars?	
	
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!	
	
    How tame, when men and women are alone,	
	
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.	
	
    How things go from him, nor resumes no care	
	
    How true a gentleman you send relief,	
	
    How went he under him?	
	
    How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,	
	
    How you were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instruments,	
	
    However faulty, yet should find respect	
	
    However, yet there is no great breach. When it comes,	
	
    Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue	
	
    Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;	
	
    I Richard's body have interred new,	
	
    I am a right maid for my cowardice;	
	
    I am about to weep; but, thinking that	
	
    I am afraid my daughter will run mad,	
	
    I am as I have spoken.	
	
    I am combined by a sacred vow,	
	
    I am content he shall reign; but I'll be Protector over him.	
	
    I am descended of a gentler blood;	
	
    I am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither.	
	
    I am in this earthly world, where to do harm	
	
    I am loath to beat thee.	
	
    I am not an impostor, that proclaim	
	
    I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.	
	
    I am one of those. His mother, wife, his child,	
	
    I am sick of this false world, and will love nought	
	
    I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.	
	
    I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.	
	
    I am that merry wanderer of the night.	
	
    I am the most unhappy woman living.	
	
    I am the turned forth, be it known to you,	
	
    I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,	
	
    I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.	
	
    I am your wife, if you will marry me;	
	
    I arn no breeching scholar in the schools,	
	
    I be not found a talker.	
	
    I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man	
	
    I boarded the King's ship; now on the beak,	
	
    I came into the world with my legs forward.	
	
    I can add colours to the chameleon,	
	
    I can no further crawl, no further go;	
	
    I can with ease produce.	
	
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both	
	
    I cannot instantly raise up the gross	
	
    I cannot sing. I'll weep, and word it with thee;	
	
    I cannot tell-	
	
    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.	
	
    I charm you, by my once commended beauty,	
	
    I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.	
	
    I come to know your pleasure.	
	
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word	
	
    I could not answer in that course of honour	
	
    I crave fit disposition for my wife,	
	
    I crave the benefit of law of arms.	
	
    I dare not say from the rich Cardinal,	
	
    I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.	
	
    I did not entertain thee as thou art.	
	
    I did repel his letters and denied	
	
    I do arrest thee of high treason here.	
	
    I do beseech you, as in way of taste,	
	
    I do beseech your lordship, call her back.	
	
    I do entreat that we may sup together.	
	
    I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,	
	
    I do not love to look on.	
	
    I do present you with a man of mine,	
	
    I do repent it from my very soul.	
	
    I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.	
	
    I dreamt my master and another fought,	
	
    I faint. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.	
	
    I fear it much; and I do fear besides	
	
    I fear we should have seen decipher'd there	
	
    I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;	
	
    I find him a fit fellow.                              Exit WOLSEY	
	
    I find myself a traitor with the rest;	
	
    I found by fortune and did give my husband,	
	
    I gave it freely ever; and there's none	
	
    I give to both your speeches- which were such	
	
    I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.	
	
    I had a feigned letter of my master's	
	
    I had in charge at my depart for France,	
	
    I had rather be alone.	
	
    I had rather seal my lips than to my peril	
	
    I hate the murderer, love him murdered.	
	
    I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,	
	
    I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing	
	
    I have a widow aunt, a dowager	
	
    I have been to you a true and humble wife,	
	
    I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,	
	
    I have done enough. A lower place, note well,	
	
    I have forsworn.	
	
    I have gone all night. Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.	
	
    I have in quick determination	
	
    I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods	
	
    I have myself resolv'd upon a course	
	
    I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.	
	
    I have not slept one wink.	
	
    I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd	
	
    I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman,	
	
    I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and	
	
    I have some private schooling for you both.	
	
    I have to use. Thy frank election make;	
	
    I have with exact view perus'd thee, Hector,	
	
    I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth:	
	
    I hear the King my father is sore sick.	
	
    I here do give thee that with all my heart	
	
    I hold me highly honoured of your Grace,	
	
    I hope this reason stands for my excuse.	
	
    I humbly thank his Grace; and from these shoulders,	
	
    I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger	
	
    I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence!	
	
    I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.	
	
    I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.	
	
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,	
	
    I know not the contents; but, as I guess	
	
    I know the shape of's leg; this is his hand,	
	
    I know we shall have revelling to-night.	
	
    I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,	
	
    I lay upon thy lips.	
	
    I leave you to your wisdom.	
	
    I like it well. France, shall we knit our pow'rs	
	
    I love Lavinia more than all the world.	
	
    I love him well; he is an honest man.	
	
    I love to cope him in these sullen fits,	
	
    I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.	
	
    I may not prove inferior to yourself.	
	
    I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter	
	
    I mean, for your particular- you had not	
	
    I met and overtook a dozen captains,	
	
    I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,	
	
    I must be held a rancorous enemy.	
	
    I must be round with him. Now he comes from hunting.	
	
    I must go seek some dewdrops here,	
	
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours	
	
    I needs must rest me.	
	
    I never in my life did look on him.	
	
    I never saw before. Great-bellied women,	
	
    I never saw the like.	
	
    I now begin with grief and shame to utter:	
	
    I only have made a mouth of his eye,	
	
    I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,	
	
    I pray for heartily, that it may find	
	
    I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house.	
	
    I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.	
	
    I pried me through the crevice of a wall,	
	
    I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.	
	
    I promis'd you redress of these same grievances	
	
    I put it in the pocket of my gown.	
	
    I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand!	
	
    I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,	
	
    I saw Othello's visage in his mind,	
	
    I saw our party to their trenches driven,	
	
    I saw young Harry with his beaver on	
	
    I say, bid come before us, Angelo.         Exit an ATTENDANT	
	
    I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,	
	
    I see a woman may be made a fool	
	
    I see thou art not for my company.	
	
    I seek to heal it only by his wealth.	
	
    I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger	
	
    I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,	
	
    I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.	
	
    I shall not want false witness to condemn me	
	
    I shall remain your debtor.	
	
    I should be author to dishonour you!	
	
    I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.	
	
    I should have found it afterwards well done,	
	
    I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,	
	
    I should your lordship.	
	
    I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy;	
	
    I speak from certainties. Nay more,	
	
    I speak not as in absolute fear of you.	
	
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement	
	
    I stole into a neighbour thicket by,	
	
    I swear 'tis better to be much abused	
	
    I take it, by all voices, that forthwith	
	
    I tell you 'tis incredible to believe.	
	
    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her	
	
    I thank my memory I yet remember	
	
    I that do bring the news made not the match.	
	
    I therefore apprehend and do attach thee	
	
    I think it best you married with the County.	
	
    I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.	
	
    I think, to liberty. Yet am I better	
	
    I thought upon one pair of English legs	
	
    I throw my warlike shield! Lay on, Macduff,	
	
    I took him for the plainest harmless creature	
	
    I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole	
	
    I turn you not away; but, like a master	
	
    I wander from the jewels that I love.	
	
    I was advertis'd their great general slept,	
	
    I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown,	
	
    I was too hot to do somebody good	
	
    I well might hear, delivered with a groan,	
	
    I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,	
	
    I will avouch't in presence of the King.	
	
    I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once	
	
    I will be very kind, and liberal	
	
    I will bring thee where Mistress Anne Page is, at a a	
	
    I will despair, and be at enmity	
	
    I will encounter with Andronicus,	
	
    I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the	
	
    I will go eat with thee, and see your knights.	
	
    I will kneel to him.	
	
    I will no more enforce mine office on you;	
	
    I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.	
	
    I will not love myself. Do you not love me?	
	
    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear	
	
    I will not wish ye half my miseries:	
	
    I will perform it to enfranchise you.	
	
    I will resolve for Scotland. There am I,	
	
    I will the banner from a trumpet take,	
	
    I will upon all hazards well believe	
	
    I wish my brother make good time with him,	
	
    I won his daughter.	
	
    I would be friends with you, and have your love,	
	
    I would be so triumphant as I am?	
	
    I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to	
	
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.	
	
    I would not be Sir Nob in any case.	
	
    I would not for a million of gold	
	
    I would not speak. I pray you spare me. Faith,	
	
    I would not wish them to a fairer death.	
	
    I would prove-	
	
    I would that I were low laid in my grave:	
	
    I would you had her spirit in such another!	
	
    I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;	
	
    I' th' dungeon by a snuff?	
	
    I' th' part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,	
	
    I' th' war do grow together; grant that, and tell me	
	
    I'll after them.                                        Exit	
	
    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;	
	
    I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,	
	
    I'll bring mine action on the proudest he	
	
    I'll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,	
	
    I'll cut thy throat.	
	
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?	
	
    I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee,	
	
    I'll find a thousand shifts to get away.	
	
    I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,	
	
    I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.	
	
    I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,	
	
    I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh	
	
    I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.	
	
    I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep	
	
    I'll keep, if but for sympathy.	
	
    I'll lend you thus much moneys'?	
	
    I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,	
	
    I'll mark no words that smooth-fac'd wooers say.	
	
    I'll mend it and then play-	
	
    I'll none of him.	
	
    I'll not serve him; he is not valiant.	
	
    I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.	
	
    I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.	
	
    I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.	
	
    I'll see thee hang'd first!	
	
    I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace.	
	
    I'll so offend to make offence a skill,	
	
    I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,	
	
    I'll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack	
	
    I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then	
	
    I'll tickle your catastrophe.	
	
    I'll to the King and signify to him	
	
    I'll use to carry thee out of this place.	
	
    I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;	
	
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,	
	
    I, after him, do after him wish too,	
	
    I, in probation of a sisterhood,	
	
    Iago, look with care about the town,	
	
    If England to itself do rest but true.                     Exeunt	
	
    If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied!	
	
    If I be traitor or unjustly fight!	
	
    If I did stay to look on his intents.	
	
    If I discover'd not which way she was gone,	
	
    If I have any grace or power to move you,	
	
    If I lov'd many words, lord, I should tell you	
	
    If I speak like a captain:	
	
    If I were much in love with vanity!	
	
    If I would yield him my virginity	
	
    If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,	
	
    If any noise or soldier you perceive	
	
    If any such be here- as God forbid!-	
	
    If by the way they be not fought withal.	
	
    If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,	
	
    If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.	
	
    If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,	
	
    If for my love, as there is no such cause,	
	
    If friend or foe, let him be gently used.	
	
    If he be guilty, as 'tis published.	
	
    If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,	
	
    If he love Caesar, all that he can do	
	
    If heaven had pleas'd to have given me longer life	
	
    If heaven would make me such another world	
	
    If it be fond, can it a woman's fear;	
	
    If it be proved against an alien	
	
    If it should give your age such cause of fear.	
	
    If law, authority, and power, deny not,	
	
    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear	
	
    If not a fedary but only he	
	
    If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,	
	
    If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.	
	
    If not- why, in a moment look to see	
	
    If quiet life be best; sweeter to you	
	
    If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!	
	
    If she had not a spirit to resist.	
	
    If so, I have derision med'cinable	
	
    If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,	
	
    If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer	
	
    If that the youth of my new int'rest here	
	
    If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,	
	
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest	
	
    If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.	
	
    If these shows be not outward, which of you	
	
    If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;	
	
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.	
	
    If this salute my blood a jot; it faints me	
	
    If this will not suffice, it must appear	
	
    If thou dar'st bring them to the baiting-place.	
	
    If thou didst, then behold that compound.	
	
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.	
	
    If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,	
	
    If thou turn back and my loud crying still.	
	
    If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,	
	
    If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.	
	
    If we are mark'd to die, we are enow	
	
    If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,	
	
    If we will keep in favour with the King,	
	
    If with the sap of reason you would quench	
	
    If yet your gentle souls fly in the air	
	
    If you be King, why should not I succeed?	
	
    If you dare fight today, come to the field;	
	
    If you do find me foul in her report,	
	
    If you do not, if I be left alone,	
	
    If you had pleas'd to have defended it	
	
    If you repay me not on such a day,	
	
    If you swear still, your recompense is still	
	
    If you were men, as men you are in show,	
	
    If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,	
	
    If you'll implore it, that will free your life,	
	
    If, or for nothing or a little,	
	
    Immediate are my needs, and my relief	
	
    Immediately to leave you and be gone.	
	
    Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends	
	
    Importune him for my moneys; be not ceas'd	
	
    Improvident soldiers! Had your watch been good	
	
    In England work your Grace's full content.	
	
    In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;	
	
    In Richard's time, and posted day and night	
	
    In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,	
	
    In a new channel fair and evenly.	
	
    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.	
	
    In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,	
	
    In any of our towns of garrison.	
	
    In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame	
	
    In bolted language; meal and bran together	
	
    In brief, for so the season bids us be,	
	
    In charging you with matters, to commit you,	
	
    In complement extern, 'tis not long after	
	
    In cradle of the rude imperious surge,	
	
    In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,	
	
    In doing this for's country. Athwart the lane	
	
    In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts.	
	
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,	
	
    In execution.	
	
    In favor's like the work we have in hand,	
	
    In fearful sense.	
	
    In forty minutes.                                  Exit PUCK	
	
    In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.	
	
    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,	
	
    In her strong toil of grace.	
	
    In his own change, or by ill officers,	
	
    In honour of a true Plantagenet,	
	
    In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;	
	
    In life so lifeless as it shows itself.	
	
    In limited professions. Rascal thieves,	
	
    In making question of my uttermost	
	
    In military rules, humours of blood,	
	
    In monumental mock'ry. Take the instant way;	
	
    In my behaviour to the majesty,	
	
    In night, and on the court and guard of safety!	
	
    In one of those same sheets.	
	
    In our long absence. Pray, do not deliver	
	
    In passion shook.	
	
    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;	
	
    In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,	
	
    In praises sauc'd with lies.	
	
    In puny battle slay me.	
	
    In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd	
	
    In right of Arthur, do I claim of thee;	
	
    In sharing that which you have pill'd from me.	
	
    In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.	
	
    In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept	
	
    In special business from his Holiness.	
	
    In such a Barley should I answer thee.	
	
    In such a place, such sum or sums as are	
	
    In such disdainful manner me to woo.	
	
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.	
	
    In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.	
	
    In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,	
	
    In the converse of breath- your gentleness	
	
    In the election of a sir so rare,	
	
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,	
	
    In the relief of this oppressed child	
	
    In the very end of harvest!	
	
    In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.	
	
    In their so sacred paths he dares to tread	
	
    In these to nature she's immediate heir;	
	
    In this day's council; but we'll take tomorrow.	
	
    In this fine age were not thought flattery,	
	
    In this uncivil and unjust extent	
	
    In thy eye that shall appear	
	
    In thy uprightness and integrity,	
	
    In very ample virtue of his father,	
	
    In warlike march these greens before your town,	
	
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark	
	
    In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.	
	
    In you, which I account his, beyond all talents.	
	
    In your embowell'd bosoms-this foul swine	
	
    Incapable and shallow innocents,	
	
    Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,	
	
    Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb-	
	
    Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires	
	
    Infusing him with self and vain conceit,	
	
    Inns of Court; down with them all.	
	
    Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms,	
	
    Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo- came I hither	
	
    Intents but merely thoughts.	
	
    Into a tow'ring passion.	
	
    Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me	
	
    Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,	
	
    Into the hands of one that loves you not;	
	
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,	
	
    Into this city's bosom.	
	
    Intolerable, not to be endur'd!	
	
    Invites me in this churlish messenger.	
	
    Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?	
	
    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?	
	
    Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election;	
	
    Is all your strict preciseness come to this?	
	
    Is as 'twere born so.	
	
    Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;	
	
    Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.	
	
    Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.	
	
    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'	
	
    Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,	
	
    Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;	
	
    Is full of weeds; her fairest flowers chok'd up,	
	
    Is he not honest?	
	
    Is his to use, so Somerset may die.	
	
    Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd,	
	
    Is it not strange and strange?	
	
    Is leaden servitor to dull delay;	
	
    Is marching hitherward in proud array,	
	
    Is most divinely vow'd upon the right	
	
    Is niece to England; look upon the years	
	
    Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?	
	
    Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?	
	
    Is not to stir without great argument,	
	
    Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,	
	
    Is of a sudden thus advanc'd in Rome?	
	
    Is oft the cease of fear.	
	
    Is our best having.	
	
    Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures	
	
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;	
	
    Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle	
	
    Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is	
	
    Is straightway calm'd, and boarded with a pirate;	
	
    Is that she will not add to her damnation	
	
    Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona	
	
    Is the determin'd respite of my wrongs;	
	
    Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?	
	
    Is this a holiday? What, know you not,	
	
    Is this the Prince, Is this the Prince's brother?	
	
    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?	
	
    Is tight and yare, and bravely rigg'd, as when	
	
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice	
	
    Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,	
	
    Is very snow-broth, one who never feels	
	
    Is yond despis'd and ruinous man my lord?	
	
    Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation	
	
    Isis, I beseech thee!	
	
    Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?	
	
    It can do me no damage'; adding further	
	
    It comes from Padua, from Bellario;	
	
    It could not move thus.	
	
    It doth remember me the more of sorrow;	
	
    It forg'd him some design, which, being believ'd,	
	
    It hath struck ten o'clock.	
	
    It honour'd him.	
	
    It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.	
	
    It is a thing most precious. But for her,	
	
    It is an earnest of a further good	
	
    It is impossible that ever Rome	
	
    It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;	
	
    It is my will; the which if thou respect,	
	
    It is not night when I do see your face,	
	
    It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,	
	
    It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.	
	
    It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;	
	
    It is your fault that I have lov'd Posthumus.	
	
    It lies to cure me, and the cure is to	
	
    It might have since been answer'd in repaying	
	
    It must not be. If Cassio do remain,	
	
    It rains downright.	
	
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,	
	
    It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,	
	
    It should be challeng'd.	
	
    It should be thus with him. He must die to-morrow.	
	
    It stands in like request?	
	
    It useth an enforced ceremony.	
	
    It was my instant death. By accident	
	
    It was wise nature's end in the donation,	
	
    It were a shame to let this land by lease;	
	
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,	
	
    It would amaze the proudest of you all.	
	
    It would control my dam's god, Setebos,	
	
    Italian, or French, let him speak to me;	
	
    JOHN FALSTAFF.'	
	
    Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying	
	
    John Falstaff- a tall gentleman, by heaven, and a most gallant	
	
    John. By the mass, I have drunk too much sack at supper. A good	
	
    Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.	
	
    Joy'd are we that you are.	
	
    Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense	
	
    Just and upright, and for your royal birth	
	
    KING PHILIP OF FRANCE	
	
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks	
	
    Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this;	
	
    Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,	
	
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,	
	
    Killing in relapse of mortality.	
	
    Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour	
	
    King Henry's faithful and anointed queen.	
	
    King Richard, he is in the mighty hold	
	
    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,	
	
    King. 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy	
	
    Kiss it, my warrior- he hath fought to-day	
	
    Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,	
	
    Knock at his study, where they say he keeps	
	
    Know that to-morrow the last of many battles	
	
    Know you not, master, to some kind of men	
	
    Knowing I lov'd my books, he furnish'd me	
	
    Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,	
	
    Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.	
	
    Laertes before you fall to play.	
	
    Laid them before you; you would throw them off	
	
    Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives;	
	
    Lastly,	
	
    Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings- remuneration.	
	
    Lavinia will I make my emperess,	
	
    Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say,	
	
    Lays her full mess before you. Want! Why want?	
	
    Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er	
	
    Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.	
	
    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.	
	
    Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once	
	
    Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.               Exit	
	
    Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,	
	
    Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:	
	
    Lend me thy handkerchief.	
	
    Lepidus, let him speak.	
	
    Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget	
	
    Lest Your retirement do amaze your friends.	
	
    Lest that it make me so unsound a man	
	
    Lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blood;	
	
    Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,	
	
    Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close;	
	
    Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,	
	
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;	
	
    Let each man do his best; and here draw I	
	
    Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,	
	
    Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,	
	
    Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here-	
	
    Let him come back, that his compassion may	
	
    Let him receive no sust'nance, fetter him,	
	
    Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd	
	
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;	
	
    Let it not, Brutus.	
	
    Let me be privileg'd by my place and message	
	
    Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man	
	
    Let me go grind their bones to powder small,	
	
    Let me have your express opinions	
	
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell	
	
    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down	
	
    Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable	
	
    Let never day nor night unhallowed pass,	
	
    Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;	
	
    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.	
	
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,	
	
    Let the high office and the honour go	
	
    Let them set on at once, for I perceive	
	
    Let two more summers wither in their pride	
	
    Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.	
	
    Let us not burden our remembrances with	
	
    Let us seem humbler after it is done	
	
    Let your close fire predominate his smoke,	
	
    Let's be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray,	
	
    Let's each one send unto his wife,	
	
    Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,	
	
    Let's reinforce or fly.                               Exeunt	
	
    Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;	
	
    Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,	
	
    Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile	
	
    Lie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.	
	
    Lies in their purses; and whoso empties them,	
	
    Life every man holds dear; but the dear man	
	
    Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress.	
	
    Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands	
	
    Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,	
	
    Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.	
	
    Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?	
	
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!	
	
    Like free and honest men, our just opinions	
	
    Like little body with a mighty heart,	
	
    Like one that draws the model of a house	
	
    Like perspectives which, rightly gaz'd upon,	
	
    Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,	
	
    Like the poor cat i' the adage?	
	
    Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves	
	
    Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,	
	
    Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.	
	
    Like youthful steers unyok'd, they take their courses	
	
    Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.	
	
    Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets,	
	
    Live with authority. So soon we shall drive back	
	
    Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.	
	
    Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!	
	
    Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold	
	
    Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum,	
	
    Lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not,	
	
    Long die thy happy days before thy death;	
	
    Longer than I have time to tell his years;	
	
    Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face:	
	
    Look in my face.	
	
    Look into these affairs see this main end-	
	
    Look to it, lords; let not his smoothing words	
	
    Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!	
	
    Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,	
	
    Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not? Why,	
	
    Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,	
	
    Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks	
	
    Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!	
	
    Lord Cardinal, he is your prisoner.	
	
    Lord John of Lancaster.	
	
    Lord Saturninus Rome's great Emperor;	
	
    Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,	
	
    Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,	
	
    Lords?	
	
    Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths	
	
    Love is a babe, then might I not say so	
	
    Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate thee;	
	
    Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done.	
	
    Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.	
	
    Lucius our Emperor; for well I know	
	
    Lust is but a bloody fire,	
	
    MICHAEL, &c., followers of Cade	
	
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,	
	
    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.	
	
    Made Britain India: every man that stood	
	
    Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,	
	
    Made him give battle to the lioness,	
	
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,	
	
    Made suit to come in's presence, which if granted,	
	
    Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.	
	
    Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away	
	
    Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,	
	
    Make boot of his distraction. Never anger	
	
    Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns;	
	
    Make her amends; she weeps.	
	
    Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body	
	
    Make mountains level, and the continent,	
	
    Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him	
	
    Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me	
	
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?	
	
    Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,	
	
    Make your best use of this; I have perform'd	
	
    Makes me forgetful?	
	
    Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers	
	
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;	
	
    Making and marring fortunes. You did know	
	
    Making the mother, wife, and child, to see	
	
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,	
	
    Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.	
	
    Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought	
	
    March all one way and be no more oppos'd	
	
    Marcius for being proud?	
	
    Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;	
	
    Mark how they whisper. Urge them while their souls	
	
    Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,	
	
    Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport-	
	
    Marry that will, I live and die a maid.	
	
    Masking the business from the common eye	
	
    Master Launcelot.	
	
    Master Silence, I will not use many words with you: Fare you	
	
    Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;	
	
    Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight	
	
    May be more free.	
	
    May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.	
	
    May give his saying deed; which is no further	
	
    May hang upon your hardness; therefore hear us.	
	
    May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit?	
	
    May make a peaceful and a sweet retire	
	
    May pass into the presence of a king,	
	
    May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute,	
	
    May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream	
	
    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs	
	
    May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.	
	
    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.	
	
    Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But alack,	
	
    Meantime let this defend my loyalty-	
	
    Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario's letter.	
	
    Meet me to-morrow in Saint George's field,	
	
    Meetest for death; the weakest kind of fruit	
	
    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;	
	
    Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,	
	
    Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.	
	
    Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?	
	
    Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!	
	
    Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends	
	
    Methinks I see him now-	
	
    Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.	
	
    Methought I sat in seat of majesty	
	
    Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,	
	
    Michaelmas?	
	
    Might happily have prov'd far worse than his.	
	
    Might so have tempted him as you have done	
	
    Might with effects of them follow our friends	
	
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,	
	
    Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.	
	
    Mine hair be fix'd an end, as one distract;	
	
    Mine innocent child?	
	
    Mine were the very cipher of a function,	
	
    Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt,	
	
    Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish; I would thy	
	
    Mistress Page; I pray you pardon me; pray heartly,	
	
    Mocking the air with colours idly spread,	
	
    Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?	
	
    More bright in zeal than the devotion which	
	
    More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;	
	
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.	
	
    More hateful to mine ear.	
	
    More mild, but yet more harmful-kind in hatred.	
	
    More needs she the divine than the physician.	
	
    More potent than the first.	
	
    More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,	
	
    More tedious than the dial eight score times?	
	
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him	
	
    More than in words?	
	
    More than that being which was like to be?	
	
    More than the locking up the spirits a time,	
	
    More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer	
	
    More worthier than their voices. They know the corn	
	
    More would I, but my lungs are wasted so	
	
    Mortal, to cut it off: to cure it, easy.	
	
    Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,	
	
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust	
	
    Most mighty Princess, that I have adventur'd	
	
    Most reverend and grave elders, to desire	
	
    Most useful for thy country.	
	
    Most venerable worth, did I devotion.	
	
    Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.            [Ascends]	
	
    Much castigation, exercise devout,	
	
    Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.	
	
    Much work for tears in many an English mother,	
	
    Murder her brothers, and then marry her!	
	
    Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend.	
	
    Must I not serve a long apprenticehood	
	
    Must be so too, if heed me; which to do	
	
    Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.	
	
    Must fetch him in he papers.	
	
    Must give us pause. There's the respect	
	
    Must kiss their own feet.	
	
    Must murder wives much better than themselves	
	
    Must not in haste abuse- if it be true,	
	
    Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it.	
	
    My Antony is away.	
	
    My Lord Protector will, I doubt it not,	
	
    My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,	
	
    My acts, decrees, and statutes, I deny.	
	
    My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;	
	
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;	
	
    My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,	
	
    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,	
	
    My brother Montague shall post to London.	
	
    My chastity's the jewel of our house,	
	
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?	
	
    My custom always of the afternoon,	
	
    My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.	
	
    My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame.	
	
    My everlasting doom of banishment.	
	
    My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.	
	
    My father and my grandfather were kings;	
	
    My father is gone wild into his grave,	
	
    My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,	
	
    My father, and make me put into contempt the suits	
	
    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest	
	
    My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,	
	
    My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb'rest	
	
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to	
	
    My griefs cry louder than advertisement.	
	
    My hand would free her, but my heart says no.	
	
    My heart doth joy that yet in all my life	
	
    My heart is sorry for your daughter's death;	
	
    My house is not a grange.	
	
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.	
	
    My lady's honour. What became of him	
	
    My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.	
	
    My lodging out.  [To a SERVANT]  Give him a livery	
	
    My lord and master loves you- O, such love	
	
    My lord, look here! Look here, Lavinia!	
	
    My lord, you'll bear us company?	
	
    My love without retention or restraint,	
	
    My loving lord, I take my leave of you;	
	
    My master is of churlish disposition,	
	
    My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,	
	
    My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled	
	
    My mother's son did get your father's heir;	
	
    My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius.	
	
    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,	
	
    My numbers lessen'd; and those few I have	
	
    My person, or my liege's sovereignty.	
	
    My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.	
	
    My rest and negligence befriends thee now,	
	
    My royal choice.	
	
    My sighs and tears and will not once relent?	
	
    My sons would never so dishonour me.	
	
    My soul the father; and these two beget	
	
    My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness	
	
    My state is desperate for my master's love;	
	
    My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners,	
	
    My tender years; and let us not forgo	
	
    My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize	
	
    My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth,	
	
    My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,	
	
    My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;	
	
    My waters-on the earth, and not on him.	
	
    My wife! My wife! What wife? I have no wife.	
	
    My will to her consent is but a part.	
	
    Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.	
	
    Myself dispos'd to sleep.	
	
    Myself have spoke in vain.	
	
    Myself, my brother, and this grieved Count	
	
    Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.	
	
    Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without	
	
    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,	
	
    Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.	
	
    Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out	
	
    Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;	
	
    Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What	
	
    Nay;	
	
    Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.	
	
    Near to the King in blood, and near in love	
	
    Neglected my sworn duty in that case.	
	
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;	
	
    Never did base and rotten policy	
	
    Never name to us: you have half our power.	
	
    Never so needful on the earth of France,	
	
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:	
	
    New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it	
	
    New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night	
	
    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.	
	
    No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.	
	
    No big-bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops' size;	
	
    No danger in what show of death it makes,	
	
    No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;	
	
    No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry	
	
    No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home;	
	
    No longer staying but to give the Mother	
	
    No matter. Wear them, betray with them. Whore still;	
	
    No more can I be severed from your side	
	
    No more the thirsty entrance of this soil	
	
    No more will I their babes. Tears virginal	
	
    No note at all of our being absent hence;	
	
    No planet is of mine.	
	
    No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,	
	
    No space of earth shall sunder our two hates;	
	
    No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;	
	
    No! yet time serves wherein you may redeem	
	
    No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,	
	
    No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.	
	
    No, no, my heart will burst, an if I speak-	
	
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,	
	
    No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness	
	
    No, with no more than if we heard that England	
	
    No; let my father seek another heir.	
	
    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye	
	
    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.	
	
    Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself	
	
    Nor be rebellious to the crown of England	
	
    Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,	
	
    Nor cease his flow of riot; takes no account	
	
    Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath;	
	
    Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd	
	
    Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw	
	
    Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,	
	
    Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?	
	
    Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish	
	
    Nor moody beggars, starving for a time	
	
    Nor never could the noble Mortimer	
	
    Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no tide-	
	
    Nor other satisfaction do I crave	
	
    Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish.	
	
    Nor sound his quillets shrilly. Hoar the flamen,	
	
    Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats	
	
    Nor the division of a battle knows	
	
    Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate	
	
    Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies	
	
    Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song.	
	
    Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.        [A tucket sounds]	
	
    Norfolk?	
	
    Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment,	
	
    Not all these, laid in bed majestical,	
	
    Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.	
	
    Not changing heart with habit, I am still	
	
    Not half an hour before.	
	
    Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,	
	
    Not lack your company.	
	
    Not one accompanying his declining foot.	
	
    Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure	
	
    Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear	
	
    Not so allur'd to feed.	
	
    Not to be other than one thing, not moving	
	
    Not to break peace, or any branch of it,	
	
    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when	
	
    Not virtuously on his own part beheld,	
	
    Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,	
	
    Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him	
	
    Nothing but lechery! All incontinent varlets!                Exit	
	
    Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me. Therefore,	
	
    Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!	
	
    Now I am alone.	
	
    Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?	
	
    Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,	
	
    Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;	
	
    Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,	
	
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,	
	
    Now good digestion wait on appetite,	
	
    Now humble as the ripest mulberry	
	
    Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?	
	
    Now leaves him.	
	
    Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,	
	
    Now powers from home and discontents at home	
	
    Now puts the drowsy and neglected act	
	
    Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.	
	
    Now therefore let us hence, and lose no hour	
	
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,	
	
    Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth	
	
    Now, Charmian!	
	
    Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?	
	
    Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right	
	
    Now, by mine honour, by my life, my troth,	
	
    Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,	
	
    Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,	
	
    Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;	
	
    Now, when the lords and barons of the realm	
	
    Now, ye familiar spirits that are cull'd	
	
    O Ceremony, show me but thy worth!	
	
    O England! model to thy inward greatness,	
	
    O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,	
	
    O anything, of nothing first create!	
	
    O brave young Prince! thy famous grandfather	
	
    O cunning, how I got it!- nay, some marks	
	
    O gentlemen, the time of life is short!	
	
    O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,	
	
    O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,	
	
    O me, 'tis my mother! How now, good lady!	
	
    O monstrous treachery! Can this be so	
	
    O my Lord Aberga'ny, fare you well!	
	
    O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!	
	
    O rarely base!	
	
    O that I could but can these dead to life!	
	
    O that estates, degrees, and offices,	
	
    O thou, the earthly author of my blood,	
	
    O villainy, villainy!	
	
    O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,	
	
    O' th' world, I would pursue it.	
	
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore	
	
    O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,	
	
    O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!	
	
    O, 'tis a tender place! and I must leave her.              Exeunt	
	
    O, above measure false!	
	
    O, by this count I shall be much in years	
	
    O, full of careful business are his looks!	
	
    O, giglot fortune!- to master Caesar's sword,	
	
    O, he's a lovely gentleman!	
	
    O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!	
	
    O, know you yet He doth it publicly.	
	
    O, let me live!	
	
    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.	
	
    O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,	
	
    O, once tell true; tell true, even for my sake!	
	
    O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,	
	
    O, step between her and her fighting soul	
	
    O, the devil take such cozeners!- God forgive me!	
	
    O, think my son to be as dear to me!	
	
    O, vengeance!	
	
    O, welcome home! And welcome, General.	
	
    O, what a sympathy of woe is this	
	
    O, would the King, Berowne and Longaville,	
	
    OFFICER. He doth appear.	
	
    Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?	
	
    Of 'came, and saw, and overcame.' With shame-	
	
    Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land	
	
    Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,	
	
    Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,	
	
    Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized	
	
    Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;	
	
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts	
	
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;	
	
    Of all our purposes. What say you to it?	
	
    Of all the gentry. There is Seward's son	
	
    Of all these ears-for where I am robb'd and bound,	
	
    Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking	
	
    Of any kindred action like to this?	
	
    Of base and bloody insurrection	
	
    Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.	
	
    Of brothers' temper, do receive you in	
	
    Of capital treason 'gainst the King and crown.	
	
    Of contradiction; being once chaf'd, he cannot	
	
    Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd	
	
    Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;	
	
    Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,	
	
    Of every realm, that did debate this business,	
	
    Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.	
	
    Of general ignorance- it must omit	
	
    Of goodly thousands. But for all this,	
	
    Of he, the worst of these three gentlemen!	
	
    Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.	
	
    Of him I was about to call his father-	
	
    Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless;	
	
    Of his own body he was ill, and gave	
	
    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;	
	
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves	
	
    Of it own fail, restraining aid to Timon,	
	
    Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit,	
	
    Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,	
	
    Of me more must be heard of, say I taught thee-	
	
    Of mine own eyes.	
	
    Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.	
	
    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,	
	
    Of my true mother.	
	
    Of noble Richard! Then true noblesse would	
	
    Of one I danc'd withal.	
	
    Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,	
	
    Of our restored love and amity.	
	
    Of pell-mell havoc and confusion.	
	
    Of plain old form is much disfigured;	
	
    Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tent,	
	
    Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,	
	
    Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;	
	
    Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion	
	
    Of such a winnowed purity in love.	
	
    Of that great shadow I did represent:	
	
    Of that integrity which should become't,	
	
    Of that we hold an idol more than he?	
	
    Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast	
	
    Of the last monarchy-see that you come	
	
    Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,	
	
    Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one	
	
    Of their observant toil, the enemies' weight-	
	
    Of these supposed crimes to give me leave	
	
    Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,	
	
    Of this most dreadful preparation,	
	
    Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?	
	
    Of this young Percy's pride? The prisoners	
	
    Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,	
	
    Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,	
	
    Of us that trade in love.	
	
    Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.	
	
    Of what conditions we shall stand upon?	
	
    Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:	
	
    Of what we think against thee.	
	
    Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,	
	
    Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six	
	
    Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,	
	
    Of your own cause.	
	
    Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.	
	
    Offending charity; if but a dozen French	
	
    Oft expectation fails, and most oft there	
	
    Old I do wax; and from my weary limbs	
	
    Old as I am, to queen it. But, I pray you,	
	
    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;	
	
    On Thursday we ourselves will march. Our meeting	
	
    On any plot of ground in Christendom.	
	
    On his behalf.	
	
    On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this!	
	
    On our entreaties, to amend your fault!	
	
    On plots and errors happen.	
	
    On some known ground of treachery in him?	
	
    On the curl'd clouds. To thy strong bidding task	
	
    On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.	
	
    On those that are, revenge: crimes, like lands,	
	
    On us thou canst not enter but by death;	
	
    On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,	
	
    Once more well met at Cyprus.	
	
    Once more, adieu; be valiant, and speed well!

    One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,	
	
    One noble man that hath one spark of fire	
	
    One of my fellows had the speed of him,	
	
    One of these three contains her heavenly picture.	
	
    One that made means to come by what he hath,	
	
    One that no persuasion can do good upon.	
	
    One who the music of his own vain tongue

    Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and

    Or add a royal number to the dead,

    Or as it were the pageants of the sea-	
	
    Or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods.	
	
    Or blessed was't we did?	
	
    Or but allay the fire of passion.	
	
    Or by some other.	
	
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.	
	
    Or doth this churlish superscription	
	
    Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.	
	
    Or else he must not only die the death,	
	
    Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.	
	
    Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.	
	
    Or else you like not of my company.	
	
    Or fill up chronicles in time to come,	
	
    Or for men's sake, the authors of these women;	
	
    Or groan for Joan? or spend a minute's time	
	
    Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;	
	
    Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.

    Other offenders we will pause upon.	
	
    Others like soldiers, armed in their stings,	
	
    Our Uncle York Lord Governor of England;	
	
    Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,	
	
    Our battle is more full of names than yours,	
	
    Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;	
	
    Our colours do return in those same hands	
	
    Our doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.	
	
    Our duties did his welcome pay.	
	
    Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.	
	
    Our great competitor. From Alexandria	
	
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard	
	
    Our inland from the pilfering borderers.	
	
    Our late King, Richard, being infected, died.	
	
    Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.	
	
    Our mettle is bred out, and they will give	
	
    Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,	
	
    Our part therein we banish with yourselves,	
	
    Our project's life this shape of sense assumes-	
	
    Our reasons laid before him-hath commanded	
	
    Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,	
	
    Our sorrow with our comfort.	
	
    Our talk must only be of Benedick.	
	
    Our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going	
	
    Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle-	
	
    Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;	
	
    Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?	
	
    Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.	
	
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch	
	
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,	
	
    Out of self-bounty be abused. Look to't.	
	
    Out of their best- is not almost a fault	
	
    Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose,	
	
    Out, rascal dogs!                [Beats and drives them out]	
	
    Outfaced infant state, and done a rape	
	
    Outworths a noble's blood.	
	
    Over the glittering helmet of my foe!	
	
    PHILOTUS	
	
    Page, which is daughter to Master George Page, which is	
	
    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.	
	
    Pale Hecate's offerings; and wither'd Murther,	
	
    Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.	
	
    Pardon's the word to all.	
	
    Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done	
	
    Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence;	
	
    Pass the remainder of our hateful days?	
	
    Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.	
	
    Patroclus kisses you.	
	
    Paying the fine of rated treachery	
	
    Peace, Tranio!	
	
    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,	
	
    Perceive I speak sincerely and high notes	
	
    Percy; I have made him sure.	
	
    Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o' th' taper	
	
    Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature	
	
    Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men.	
	
    Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.	
	
    Petruchio	
	
    Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take	
	
    Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!	
	
    Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;	
	
    Pity was all the fault that was in me;	
	
    Play something like the murther of my father	
	
    Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.	
	
    Plays in the right hand, thus; but tell him	
	
    Pleas'd with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.	
	
    Plot some device of further misery	
	
    Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,	
	
    Pluck'd from my arms perforce, and given away	
	
    Poins; he is of too high a region, he knows too much. No,	
	
    Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.	
	
    Poor breathing orators of miseries,	
	
    Poor shadows of Elysium, hence and rest	
	
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!	
	
    Post you to London, and you will find it so;	
	
    Praising her when I am dumb.	
	
    Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!	
	
    Pray heaven the King may never find a heart	
	
    Pray, set it down and rest you; when this burns,	
	
    Preferment goes by letter and affection,	
	
    Present approach.	
	
    Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.	
	
    Presumptuous vassals, are you not asham'd	
	
    Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain;	
	
    Prince John, your son, doth kiss your Grace's hand.	
	
    Princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show,	
	
    Prithee call Gardiner to me, my new secretary;	
	
    Proceed by swallowing that; for he believes	
	
    Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.	
	
    Procure your sureties for your days of answer.	
	
    Produce his body to the marketplace,	
	
    Promis'd to Harry and his followers.	
	
    Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,	
	
    Protest their first of manhood.	
	
    Proud setter up and puller down of kings!	
	
    Prove that ever I dress myself handsome till thy return. Well,	
	
    Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,	
	
    Prunes the immortal wing, and cloys his beak,	
	
    Puppies!	
	
    Pursue we him on knees; for I have dreamt	
	
    Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made	
	
    Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath,	
	
    Put up thy gold. Go on. Here's gold. Go on.	
	
    Put your dread pleasures more into command	
	
    QUINCE, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, STARVELING, AND SNUG	
	
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,	
	
    Question enrages him. At once, good night.	
	
    Quite from himself to God. But now behold	
	
    Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,	
	
    Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come	
	
    Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,	
	
    Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other;	
	
    Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,	
	
    Rather than life preserv'd with infamy.	
	
    Razing the characters of your renown,	
	
    Re-enter POSTHUMUS, and seconds the Britons; they rescue	
	
    Reason becomes the marshal to my will,	
	
    Receiv'd his love?	
	
    Receive it from me, then: war and confusion	
	
    Recover'd is the town of Orleans.	
	
    Refuse you for my judge, whom yet once more	
	
    Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;	
	
    Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!	
	
    Religiously they ask a sacrifice.	
	
    Remember I have done thee worthy service,	
	
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!	
	
    Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.	
	
    Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall	
	
    Repair to th' Capitol.	
	
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;	
	
    Reports but coarsely of her.	
	
    Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.	
	
    Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,	
	
    Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.	
	
    Resume that spirit when you were wont to say,	
	
    Retorts to chiding fortune.	
	
    Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.	
	
    Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,	
	
    Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend;	
	
    Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,	
	
    Richard cried 'Charge, and give no foot of ground!'	
	
    Richer than sea and land? O theft most base,	
	
    Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat	
	
    Right true it is your son Lucentio here	
	
    Rise from thy stool.	
	
    Rivers,	
	
    Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and be	
	
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing	
	
    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;	
	
    Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,	
	
    Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb	
	
    Ruling in large and ample empery	
	
    Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.	
	
    Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree,	
	
    SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience	
	
    SENTINEL. Arm! arm! The enemy doth make assault.	
	
    Safest in shame. Being fool'd, by fool'ry thrive.	
	
    Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?	
	
    Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets	
	
    Saucy and overbold? How did you dare	
	
    Save mine, which hath desir'd to see thee more;	
	
    Save that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense,	
	
    Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen	
	
    Say 'I am none of thine.'	
	
    Say I command her come to me.                    Exit GRUMIO	
	
    Say as you think, and speak it from your souls:	
	
    Say it did so a little time before	
	
    Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.	
	
    Say we intend to try his Grace to-day,	
	
    Say, shall the current of our right run on?	
	
    Saying I lik'd her ere I went to wars.	
	
    Says it is past her cure.	
	
    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;	
	
    Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.	
	
    Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be	
	
    Seals a commission to a blank of danger;	
	
    Seditious to his Grace and to the state.	
	
    See if thou canst outface me with thy looks;	
	
    See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd	
	
    See where they come: I'll warrant they'll make it good.	
	
    See you now-	
	
    See, here's 'To Jove' and this 'To Mercury';	
	
    Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,	
	
    Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands	
	
    Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.	
	
    Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.	
	
    Seems to cry out 'How shall that Claribel	
	
    Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort	
	
    Send after the Duke, and appeal to him.	
	
    Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,	
	
    Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,	
	
    Sent from your brother, Marquis Montague.	
	
    Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!	
	
    Set down our host. My partner in this action,	
	
    Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;	
	
    Setting aside his high blood's royalty,	
	
    Sh' adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,	
	
    Shake off slumber, and beware.	
	
    Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead.	
	
    Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?	
	
    Shall I twice lose.	
	
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;	
	
    Shall be a wall sufficient to defend	
	
    Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?	
	
    Shall be the label to another deed,	
	
    Shall better speak of you than you deserve.	
	
    Shall break into corruption' so went on,	
	
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;	
	
    Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus;	
	
    Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,	
	
    Shall from this practice but make hard your heart;	
	
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.	
	
    Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar	
	
    Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death	
	
    Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?	
	
    Shall more attend upon the coming space,	
	
    Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power	
	
    Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do't, I feel.	
	
    Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.	
	
    Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,	
	
    Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.	
	
    Shall sun that morrow see!	
	
    Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives,	
	
    Shall to the edge of all extremity	
	
    Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sweet girl?	
	
    Shall we go, coz?	
	
    Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously.	
	
    Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,	
	
    Sham'st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,	
	
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,	
	
    She comes more nearer earth than she was wont	
	
    She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,	
	
    She had dispos'd with Caesar, and that your rage	
	
    She is Lavinia, therefore must be lov'd.	
	
    She is alone th' Arabian bird, and I	
	
    She is corrupted, chang'd, and won from thee;	
	
    She is your treasure, she must have a husband;	
	
    She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;	
	
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post	
	
    She ne'er had known pomp; though't be temporal,	
	
    She shall be lov'd and fear'd. Her own shall bless her:	
	
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.	
	
    She speaks this in th' infirmity of sense.	
	
    She that in wisdom never was so frail	
	
    She was too good for me. But, as I said,	
	
    She will not come; she bids you come to her.	
	
    She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.	
	
    She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.	
	
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief	
	
    Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,	
	
    Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,	
	
    Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!	
	
    Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,	
	
    Should be without regard. What's done is done.	
	
    Should ever get that privilege of me.	
	
    Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?	
	
    Should know we were afoot.	
	
    Should make desire vomit emptiness,	
	
    Should notwithstanding join our lights together	
	
    Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.	
	
    Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood	
	
    Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,         [Digging]	
	
    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,	
	
    Show me thy thought.	
	
    Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,	
	
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.	
	
    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight	
	
    Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe.	
	
    Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being there tomorrow,	
	
    Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,	
	
    Since I have lost thee!	
	
    Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'	
	
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,	
	
    Since last we saw in France?	
	
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear	
	
    Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck	
	
    Since the exile of Posthumus, most retir'd	
	
    Since we can not atone you, we shall see	
	
    Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.	
	
    Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,	
	
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,	
	
    Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother's death	
	
    Sir Robert might have eat his part in me	
	
    Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?	
	
    Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.	
	
    Sir-I may tell it you-I think I have	
	
    Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-	
	
    Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;	
	
    Sit, then, and talk with her; she is thine own.	
	
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man	
	
    Six years we banish him, and he shall go.	
	
    Slander her love, and he forgave it her.	
	
    Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,	
	
    Sluttery, to such neat excellence oppos'd,	
	
    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;	
	
    Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,	
	
    So 'twere not long of him; but being ent'red,	
	
    So Caesar shall not find them.	
	
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,	
	
    So are you, princes English, every one.	
	
    So be it; either to the uttermost,	
	
    So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;	
	
    So cowardly; and but for these vile 'guns,	
	
    So do you too, where you perceive them thick.	
	
    So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts,	
	
    So every scope by the immoderate use	
	
    So far exceed all instance, all discourse,	
	
    So fearful were they of infection.	
	
    So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,	
	
    So good, so noble, and so true a master?	
	
    So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread	
	
    So help me every spirit sanctified,	
	
    So honour peereth in the meanest habit.	
	
    So in the earth, to this day is not known.	
	
    So it may prove an argument of laughter	
	
    So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness	
	
    So long as I am loyal, true, and crimeless.	
	
    So madly hot that no discourse of reason,	
	
    So many courses of the sun enthroned,	
	
    So may he with more facile question bear it,	
	
    So mighty are his vowed enemies.	
	
    So much applauded through the realm of France?	
	
    So much misconstrued in his wantonness.	
	
    So noble a master fall'n! All gone, and not	
	
    So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;	
	
    So please you, save the thanks this prince expects.	
	
    So shall I clothe me in a forced content	
	
    So shall she leave her blessedness to one-	
	
    So should we save a valiant gentleman	
	
    So sought'st to hinder.	
	
    So strongly guarded.  [To ARTHUR]  Cousin, look not sad;	
	
    So sweet is zealous contemplation.	
	
    So tell your master.	
	
    So that perforce you must needs stay a time.	
	
    So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,	
	
    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.	
	
    So to the Moor.	
	
    So true a fool is love, that in your will,	
	
    So well I know my duty to my elders.	
	
    So well as by reflection, I your glass	
	
    So worthy as thy birth.	
	
    So you do condescend to help me now.	
	
    So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music	
	
    So, so. Well done, well done.	
	
    So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so,	
	
    So.

    Some falls are means the happier to arise.            Exeunt	
	
    Some little time; so by your companies	
	
    Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.	
	
    Some of us love you well; and even those some

    Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners	
	
    Some two months hence up higher toward the north	
	
    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,	
	
    Something to save thy life.	
	
    Sometimes I'll say I am Duke Humphrey's wife,	
	
    Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times	
	
    Son to the elder brother of this man,	
	
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,	
	
    Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;	
	
    Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!	
	
    Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:	
	
    Speak loudly for him.	
	
    Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,	
	
    Speak to the people, and they pity her.	
	
    Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?	
	
    Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,	
	
    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?	
	
    Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,	
	
    Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.	
	
    Spring come to you at the farthest,	
	
    Spurr'd, gall'd, and tir'd, by jauncing Bolingbroke.	
	
    Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.	
	
    Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve.	
	
    Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,	
	
    Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!	
	
    Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop's deer?	
	
    Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses	
	
    State-statues only.	
	
    Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown.	
	
    Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when	
	
    Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out the burly bon'd	
	
    Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;	
	
    Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,	
	
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;	
	
    Still met the King, lov'd him next heav'n, obey'd him,	
	
    Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:	
	
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age	
	
    Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight;	
	
    Stoop'd as to foot us. His ascension is	
	
    Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture	
	
    Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.	
	
    Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them	
	
    Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,	
	
    Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints	
	
    Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,	
	
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,	
	
    Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend	
	
    Subscrib'd by th' consuls and patricians,	
	
    Successful in the battles that he fights,	
	
    Such are the poor, in health- or else a feast,	
	
    Such as is bent on unlike majesty	
	
    Such as we see when men restrain their breath	
	
    Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,	
	
    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,	
	
    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,	
	
    Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming	
	
    Such tricks hath strong imagination	
	
    Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule	
	
    Summon their general unto the wall.	
	
    Supplied with worthy men! plant love among's!	
	
    Suppose the singing birds musicians,	
	
    Surely, by all the glory you have won,	
	
    Suspect me that I mean no good to him.	
	
    Swear by my sword.	
	
    Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,	
	
    Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook	
	
    Sweet is the country, because full of riches;	
	
    Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands	
	
    Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,	
	
    Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed	
	
    T' extol what it hath done.	
	
    THREE STRANGERS	
	
    TIMON of Athens	
	
    Take all myself.	
	
    Take heed the Queen come not within his sight;	
	
    Take him away; he knows I know him well.	
	
    Take no unkindness of his hasty words.	
	
    Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,	
	
    Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,	
	
    Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.	
	
    Take up the sword again, or take up me.	
	
    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,	
	
    Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,	
	
    Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor.	
	
    Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast;	
	
    Teach thy necessity to reason thus:	
	
    Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,	
	
    Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree	
	
    Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,	
	
    Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England	
	
    Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;	
	
    Tell me, how fares our loving mother?	
	
    Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?	
	
    Tell us the Dauphin's mind.	
	
    Tells Harry that the King doth offer him	
	
    Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,	
	
    Tend'ring our sister's honour and our own.	
	
    Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,	
	
    Th' advised head defends itself at home;	
	
    Th' enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint	
	
    Th' imaginary relish is so sweet	
	
    Th' offence is holy that she hath committed;	
	
    Th' uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;	
	
    Th' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.	
	
    Than I am made by my young lord and thee!	
	
    Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,	
	
    Than Rhodope's of Memphis ever was.	
	
    Than a joint burden laid upon us all.	
	
    Than amply to imbar their crooked tides	
	
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.	
	
    Than breath or pen can give expressure to.	
	
    Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world	
	
    Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak.	
	
    Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself,	
	
    Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg	
	
    Than greatness going off.	
	
    Than hear say how I got them.	
	
    Than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate.	
	
    Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great,	
	
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.	
	
    Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness,	
	
    Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.	
	
    Than one which holds a trencher.	
	
    Than prosecute the meanest or the best	
	
    Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.	
	
    Than such a murther is.	
	
    Than that poor Brutus with himself at war	
	
    Than the rebuke you give it.	
	
    Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;	
	
    Than this pure soul shall be. All princely graces	
	
    Than those proud titles thou hast won of me.	
	
    Than thou of them. Come all to ruin. Let	
	
    Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;	
	
    Than to suspicion.	
	
    Than what befalls myself. You stand amaz'd;	
	
    Than when I first my wedded mistress saw	
	
    Than wife is to the husband? If this law	
	
    Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,	
	
    Than you have heard him brag to you he will.	
	
    Thanks you for this great care; I stood i' th' level	
	
    That Angelo is an adulterous thief,	
	
    That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;	
	
    That Cassio's not alive.	
	
    That England, being empty of defence,	
	
    That God fought for us.	
	
    That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,	
	
    That I am free of your report, he knows	
	
    That I an accessary needs must be,	
	
    That I did never, no, nor never can,	
	
    That I have been disloyal to thy bed	
	
    That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.	
	
    That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?	
	
    That I in all despite might rail at him,	
	
    That I may pass this doing.	
	
    That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,	
	
    That I must die here, and live hence by truth?	
	
    That I protest I simply am a maid.	
	
    That I shall lose distinction in my joys;	
	
    That I to your assistance do make love,	
	
    That I was worse than nothing; for indeed	
	
    That I yet know not?	
	
    That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,	
	
    That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.	
	
    That Photinus an eunuch and your maids	
	
    That Talbot is but shadow of himself?	
	
    That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.	
	
    That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,	
	
    That all the courts of France will be disturb'd	
	
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,	
	
    That any purblind eye may find it out.	
	
    That are misled upon your cousin's part;	
	
    That are your prisoners-	
	
    That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves	
	
    That beauty am I bless'd with which you may see.	
	
    That bids me be of comfort any more.	
	
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;	
	
    That box I gave you was not thought by me	
	
    That brought you home and boldly did outdare	
	
    That by the top doth take the mountain pine	
	
    That came too lag to see him buried.	
	
    That cannot be; you are a councillor,	
	
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,	
	
    That charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say.	
	
    That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome	
	
    That could not live asunder day or night.	
	
    That dare leave two together. Fare you well.            Exit	
	
    That death and nature do contend about them,	
	
    That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.	
	
    That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them	
	
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.	
	
    That done, I will be walking on the works;	
	
    That doth not smack of observation-	
	
    That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,	
	
    That e'er I prov'd thee false or fear'd thy faith.	
	
    That even now he cries aloud for him.	
	
    That ever death should let life bear his name,	
	
    That ever did contain a thing of worth.	
	
    That ever wall-ey'd wrath or staring rage	
	
    That every minute of his being thrusts	
	
    That excellent grand tyrant of the earth	
	
    That faith would live again by death of need.	
	
    That fears him much, and my misgiving still	
	
    That first we come to words; and therefore have we	
	
    That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.	
	
    That fram'd him thus. Time, with his fairer hand,	
	
    That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.	
	
    That give a name to every fixed star	
	
    That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?	
	
    That grief and patience, rooted in him both,	
	
    That had a head to hit, either young or old,	
	
    That had before my face murd'red my father-	
	
    That has such people in't!	
	
    That hath been breeder of these dire events.	
	
    That hath express'd himself in all his deeds	
	
    That hath thrown down so many enemies,	
	
    That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,	
	
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,	
	
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg	
	
    That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.	
	
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,	
	
    That he quit being; and his gentle lady,	
	
    That he spake to thee?	
	
    That he will neither know how to maintain it	
	
    That he would steal away so guilty-like,	
	
    That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together	
	
    That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.       [Floulish]	
	
    That holds in chase mine honour up and down?	
	
    That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,	
	
    That in a Christian climate souls refin'd	
	
    That in alliance, amity, and oaths,	
	
    That in the course of justice none of us	
	
    That in this quarrel have been overthrown	
	
    That is an old device, and it was play'd	
	
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him	
	
    That is thy means to live. Do thou but think	
	
    That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;	
	
    That is, were I under the terms of death,	
	
    That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!	
	
    That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion'd	
	
    That justice seizes. What knows the laws	
	
    That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;	
	
    That know the strong'st and surest way to get.	
	
    That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.	
	
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,	
	
    That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,	
	
    That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,	
	
    That longing have been sick for, ere I'd yield	
	
    That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,	
	
    That made you break this enterprise to me?	
	
    That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power,	
	
    That malice bears down truth. And, I beseech you,	
	
    That many things, having full reference	
	
    That may repeat and history his los	
	
    That men must lay their murthers on your neck.	
	
    That might relieve you!	
	
    That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.	
	
    That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands	
	
    That my disports corrupt and taint my business,	
	
    That nature must compel us to lament	
	
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;	
	
    That no man enter till my tale be done.	
	
    That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,	
	
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.	
	
    That now our loss might be ten times so much?	
	
    That of his fortunes you should make a staff	
	
    That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.	
	
    That our great king himself doth woo me oft	
	
    That owes two buckets, filling one another;	
	
    That play'st so subtly with a king's repose.	
	
    That promise noble service; and they come	
	
    That pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow,	
	
    That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns,	
	
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,	
	
    That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.	
	
    That see I by our faces. We are fellows still,	
	
    That severs day from night.	
	
    That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart	
	
    That shall salute our rightful sovereign	
	
    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,	
	
    That she may long live here, God say Amen!            Exeunt	
	
    That she'll demand. A ring the County wears	
	
    That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.	
	
    That singes heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.'	
	
    That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,	
	
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence	
	
    That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.	
	
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests	
	
    That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,	
	
    That stays upon me; whose persuasion is	
	
    That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!	
	
    That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley	
	
    That sways the earth this climate overlooks,	
	
    That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.	
	
    That taught his son the office of a fowl!	
	
    That the fix'd sentinels almost receive	
	
    That the mad Brutus ended; he alone	
	
    That the time's enemies may not have this	
	
    That their events can never fall out good.              Exit	
	
    That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose	
	
    That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them,	
	
    That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,	
	
    That they take place when virtue's steely bones	
	
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth	
	
    That this my death may never be forgot-	
	
    That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.	
	
    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.	
	
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.	
	
    That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up.	
	
    That thou thyself was born in bastardy;	
	
    That thought them sure of you.	
	
    That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars	
	
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-	
	
    That to your wanting may be minist'red.	
	
    That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?	
	
    That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,	
	
    That very envy and the tongue of los	
	
    That war against your own affections	
	
    That was not born of woman? Such a one	
	
    That we are here.                      Exeunt from the walls	
	
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,	
	
    That we have had no time to move our daughter.	
	
    That we meet here so strangely; but her son	
	
    That we shall hardly in our ages see	
	
    That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear	
	
    That were impossible; but I pray you both,	
	
    That were the cause of my imprisonment.	
	
    That whatsoever I did bid thee do,	
	
    That which I have than, coveting for more,	
	
    That which combin'd us was most great, and let not	
	
    That will be given to th' loud of noise we make.	
	
    That will not hold the handling. Or say to them	
	
    That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but	
	
    That with the plume; 'tis a most gallant fellow.	
	
    That woe is me to think upon thy woes,	
	
    That would make good of bad and friends of foes!	
	
    That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.	
	
    That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think	
	
    That you are odd, and he is even with you.	
	
    That you divest yourself, and lay apart	
	
    That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.	
	
    That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.	
	
    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!	
	
    That you take with unthankfulness his doing.	
	
    That you withdraw you and abate your strength,	
	
    That's Christian care enough. For living murmurers	
	
    That's due to all the villains past, in being,	
	
    That's sure of death without it- at once pluck out	
	
    That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!	
	
    That, being brought into the open air,	
	
    That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,	
	
    That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit	
	
    That, in th' official marks invested, you	
	
    That, plucking to unfix an enemy,	
	
    That, till the father rid his hands of her,	
	
    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.	
	
    The Archbishop.	
	
    The Britons have raz'd out, though with the loss	
	
    The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads	
	
    The Dian of that time. So doth my wife	
	
    The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish	
	
    The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.	
	
    The Duke retain'd him his. But on: what hence?	
	
    The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforc'd me.	
	
    The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.	
	
    The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the	
	
    The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,	
	
    The King has gone beyond me. All my glories	
	
    The King hath yielded unto thy demand:	
	
    The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,	
	
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,	
	
    The King your father is dispos'd to sleep.	
	
    The King, on his own royal disposition	
	
    The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,	
	
    The Prince but studies his companions	
	
    The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,	
	
    The Princess of this country, and the air on't	
	
    The Queen, and Princess.                              Exeunt	
	
    The Senate hath sent about three several quests	
	
    The Welshmen are dispers'd; and Salisbury	
	
    The absolute soldiership you have by land;	
	
    The acts commenced on this ball of earth.	
	
    The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,	
	
    The aptest way for safety and revenge.	
	
    The article of my oath-	
	
    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,	
	
    The bearer knows not, but commends itself	
	
    The bell then beating one-	
	
    The best is past. Brother, my lord the Duke,	
	
    The better arm you to the sudden time	
	
    The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix	
	
    The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time	
	
    The book of his good acts whence men have read	
	
    The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face-	
	
    The breath of worldly men cannot depose	
	
    The business present; 'tis his Highness' pleasure	
	
    The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,	
	
    The cause of our expedience to the Queen,	
	
    The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,	
	
    The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter'd,	
	
    The city is well stor'd.	
	
    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,	
	
    The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.	
	
    The common people by numbers swarm to us.	
	
    The confident and over-lusty French	
	
    The constant service of the antique world,	
	
    The course of true love never did run smooth;	
	
    The court's a learning-place, and he is one-	
	
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.	
	
    The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.	
	
    The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory,	
	
    The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.	
	
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.	
	
    The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,	
	
    The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!-	
	
    The dogs o' th' street to bay me. Every villain	
	
    The dove, and very blessed spirit of peace-	
	
    The ears are senseless that should give us bearing	
	
    The elements be kind to thee and make	
	
    The empire of the sea; our slippery people,	
	
    The envious slanders of her false accusers;	
	
    The eye of majesty.	
	
    The eye of reason may pry in upon us.	
	
    The fashion- less without and more within.              Exit	
	
    The fear of that holds off my present aid.	
	
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,	
	
    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look	
	
    The first-begotten and the lawful heir	
	
    The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more	
	
    The foot above the head.	
	
    The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus	
	
    The fountain from the which my current runs,	
	
    The frame and huge foundation of the earth	
	
    The galloping of horse. Who wast came by?	
	
    The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home	
	
    The gentle Thetis, and anon behold	
	
    The gods defend him from so great a shame!	
	
    The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if	
	
    The good is oft interred with their bones;	
	
    The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,	
	
    The greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus] Thanks for your	
	
    The greatness of his person.	
	
    The hands of Romans!	
	
    The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late,	
	
    The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.	
	
    The heart that conn'd them.	
	
    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;	
	
    The high imperial type of this earth's glory.	
	
    The honey of his language. No, he's settled,	
	
    The hopes of court! My hopes in heaven do dwell.           Exeunt	
	
    The hue of dungeons, and the school of night;	
	
    The icy precepts of respect, but followed	
	
    The imperious churchman; Somerset, Buckingham,	
	
    The interruption of their churlish drums	
	
    The issue of the next son should have reign'd.	
	
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out	
	
    The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath assembled	
	
    The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.	
	
    The last is for my men-they are the poorest,	
	
    The law I bear no malice for my death:	
	
    The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I	
	
    The legions now in Gallia sooner landed	
	
    The letter, as I live, with all the business	
	
    The light and careless livery that it wears	
	
    The lining of his coffers shall make coats	
	
    The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!	
	
    The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment	
	
    The mailed Mars Shall on his altar sit	
	
    The man I speak of cannot in the world	
	
    The map of honour, truth, and loyalty!	
	
    The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,	
	
    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand	
	
    The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss	
	
    The mettle of your pasture; let us swear	
	
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings	
	
    The money is paid back again.	
	
    The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle	
	
    The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted	
	
    The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion	
	
    The mouths, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men	
	
    The name and not the thing.	
	
    The narrow-prying father, Minola,	
	
    The nearer bloody.	
	
    The next news is, I have to London sent	
	
    The noble Antony.	
	
    The noble change that I have purposed!	
	
    The noisome weeds which without profit suck	
	
    The nonpareil of beauty!	
	
    The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber	
	
    The one is Caius Lucius.	
	
    The one side must have bale.	
	
    The other did not so.	
	
    The other half in use, to render it	
	
    The other, at high wish. Best state, contentless,	
	
    The owner of the house I did inquire for?	
	
    The part I came in. Fight I will no more,	
	
    The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,	
	
    The penalty and forfeit of my bond.	
	
    The people's magistrates.	
	
    The petty difference we yet not know.	
	
    The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,	
	
    The pound of flesh which I demand of him	
	
    The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,	
	
    The precious note of it with a base slave,	
	
    The press of boats or pride. A piece of work	
	
    The pride upon them, that their very labour	
	
    The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,	
	
    The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,	
	
    The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring	
	
    The rather, for I now must make you know	
	
    The raven himself is hoarse	
	
    The repetition in a woman's ear	
	
    The rest do nothing- with this word 'Stand, stand!'	
	
    The rich advantage of good exercise?	
	
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.	
	
    The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks	
	
    The same upon your finger.	
	
    The scatt'red foe that hopes to rise again;	
	
    The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts	
	
    The secrets of my heart.	
	
    The service that you three have done is more	
	
    The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,	
	
    The shame hereof will make me hide my head.	
	
    The sight of me is odious in their eyes;	
	
    The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;	
	
    The slavish motive of recanting fear,	
	
    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?	
	
    The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,	
	
    The soul and body rive not more in parting	
	
    The speediness of your return.	
	
    The stale of horses and the gilded puddle	
	
    The steps of wrong-should move you to mew up	
	
    The stomach of my sense. Would I had never	
	
    The stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs?	
	
    The suit which you demand is gone and dead:	
	
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,	
	
    The sun will set before I shall discharge	
	
    The supreme seat, the throne majestical,	
	
    The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;	
	
    The thief doth fear each bush an officer.	
	
    The third he caper'd, and cried 'All goes well.'	
	
    The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this:	
	
    The time and my intents are savage-wild,	
	
    The time is fair again.	
	
    The tongue offends not that reports his death;	
	
    The traitor speak, and timorously confess	
	
    The treasure in this field achiev'd and city,	
	
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,	
	
    The truth on our side.	
	
    The tutor and the feeder of my riots.	
	
    The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.	
	
    The valiant never taste of death but once.	
	
    The venomous malice of my swelling heart!	
	
    The very heart of kindness.	
	
    The very thought of this fair company	
	
    The very train of her worst wearing gown	
	
    The virtuous Cranmer.	
	
    The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,	
	
    The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.	
	
    The way which promises assurance; and	
	
    The well-appointed King at Hampton pier	
	
    The which he could not levy; whereupon	
	
    The which observ'd, a man may prophesy,	
	
    The whole world shall not save him.	
	
    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,	
	
    The woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome.	
	
    The world esteem'd thy father honourable,	
	
    The world's large spaces cannot parallel.	
	
    The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk,	
	
    The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,	
	
    The yielding of her up?	
	
    Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.	
	
    Their chiefest prospect murd'ring basilisks!	
	
    Their counsel turns to passion, which before	
	
    Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,	
	
    Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.	
	
    Their mercy at the price of one fair word,	
	
    Their mother's bedchamber should not be safe	
	
    Their perch, and not their terror.	
	
    Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,	
	
    Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;	
	
    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,	
	
    Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.	
	
    Then at my suit look graciously on him;	
	
    Then brook abridgment; and your eyes advance,	
	
    Then doth it well appear the Salique law	
	
    Then everything includes itself in power,	
	
    Then happy I that love and am beloved	
	
    Then homeward every man attach the hand	
	
    Then if you fight against God's enemy,	
	
    Then lays his finger on his temple; straight	
	
    Then let the worst, unheard, fall on your head.	
	
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-	
	
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,	
	
    Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst	
	
    Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,	
	
    Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;	
	
    Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!	
	
    Then well one more may fair Bianca have;	
	
    Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,	
	
    Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.	
	
    Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;	
	
    Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much	
	
    Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,	
	
    Then, taking him from thence that is not there,	
	
    There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;	
	
    There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him	
	
    There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,	
	
    There is a change upon you.	
	
    There is a queen, attended by a Moor;	
	
    There is a tide in the affairs of men	
	
    There is either liquor in his pate or money in his purse	
	
    There is no malice in this burning coal;	
	
    There is no primer business.	
	
    There is no virtue like necessity.	
	
    There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet	
	
    There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.	
	
    There my Lysander and myself shall meet;	
	
    There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be	
	
    There shalt thou find the mariners asleep	
	
    There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.	
	
    There was a lady once-'tis an old story-	
	
    There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas	
	
    There will we make our peds of roses,	
	
    There ye shall meet about this weighty business-	
	
    There's a whole merchant's venture of Bourdeaux stuff in him; you	
	
    There's many a gentle person made a Jack.	
	
    There's meaning in thy snores.	
	
    There's my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with	
	
    There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st	
	
    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight	
	
    There's something in me that reproves my fault;	
	
    There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,	
	
    Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.	
	
    Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;	
	
    Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go.	
	
    Therefore come you with us, and let him go.	
	
    Therefore is it most expedient for the wise, if Don Worm (his	
	
    Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.	
	
    Therefore present to her-as sometimes Margaret	
	
    Therefore still bear the balance and the sword;	
	
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.	
	
    Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his	
	
    Therefore, at last, I firmly am resolv'd	
	
    Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known	
	
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,	
	
    Therein illustrated; the honour of it	
	
    Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',	
	
    These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,	
	
    These counties were the keys of Normandy!	
	
    These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!	
	
    These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his;	
	
    These griefs and losses have so bated me	
	
    These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.	
	
    These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.	
	
    These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.	
	
    These that I bring unto their latest home,	
	
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.	
	
    These, as I learn, and such like toys as these	
	
    They are black vesper's pageants.	
	
    They are not constant, but are changing still	
	
    They are, as all my other comforts, far hence,	
	
    They call'd us, for our fierceness, English dogs;	
	
    They cut thy sister's tongue, and ravish'd her,	
	
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,	
	
    They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase	
	
    They have chang'd eyes. Delicate Ariel,	
	
    They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,	
	
    They hither march amain, under conduct	
	
    They must lie there. Go carry them, and smear	
	
    They never then had sprung like summer flies;	
	
    They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died;	
	
    They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est; but yond man is ever	
	
    They set the same; and there it doth remain,	
	
    They stared, and were distracted; no man's life	
	
    They that must weigh out my afflictions,	
	
    They told me, here, at dead time of the night,	
	
    They wilfully themselves exil'd from light,	
	
    They would not pity me; yet plead I must,	
	
    They'll say 'tis nought; others to hear the city	
	
    Thieves for their robbery have authority	
	
    Thine being but a moiety of my moan-	
	
    Things done undone; but if he be at hand,	
	
    Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,	
	
    Think not that Henry shall be so depos'd.	
	
    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,	
	
    Think you I bear the shears of destiny?	
	
    Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy,	
	
    Third son to the third Edward, King of England.	
	
    This King of Naples, being an enemy	
	
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,	
	
    This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,	
	
    This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;	
	
    This bond expires- I do expect return	
	
    This candle burns not clear. 'Tis I must snuff it;	
	
    This dastard, at the battle of Patay,	
	
    This day is call'd the feast of Crispian.	
	
    This dead King to the living King I'll bear.	
	
    This deity in my bosom; twenty consciences	
	
    This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones	
	
    This eye shoots forth! How big imagination	
	
    This friendly treaty of our threat'ned town?	
	
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,	
	
    This happy child did I get anything.	
	
    This head of safety, and withal to pry	
	
    This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten. O!	
	
    This is a dreadful sentence.	
	
    This is a trick to put me from my suit.	
	
    This is his lordship's man.	
	
    This is not strong enough to be believ'd	
	
    This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice,	
	
    This is the fool that lent out money gratis.	
	
    This is the last. So we will home to Rome,	
	
    This is the very false gallop of verses; why do you infect	
	
    This knight, no less for bounty bound to us	
	
    This late dissension grown betwixt the peers	
	
    This little one shall make it holiday.                     Exeunt	
	
    This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child.	
	
    This might have been prevented and made whole	
	
    This music crept by me upon the waters,	
	
    This news hath made thee a most ugly man.	
	
    This night the siege assuredly I'll raise.	
	
    This ornament of knighthood-yea or no.	
	
    This part of his conjoins with my disease	
	
    This peroration with such circumstance?	
	
    This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!	
	
    This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen	
	
    This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,	
	
    This ship-boy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite.	
	
    This speedy and quick appearance argues proof	
	
    This sudden execution of my will.	
	
    This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians	
	
    This tongue had not offended so today,	
	
    This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,	
	
    This villanous saltpetre should be digg'd	
	
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.	
	
    This was the most unkindest cut of all;	
	
    This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.	
	
    This will I send; and something else more plain	
	
    This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou,	
	
    Thorough the streets of Rome?	
	
    Those he commands move only in command,	
	
    Those prisoners in your Highness' name demanded	
	
    Those that with haste will make a mighty fire	
	
    Those that would die or ere resist are grown	
	
    Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,	
	
    Thou art a guard too wanton for the head	
	
    Thou art as opposite to every good	
	
    Thou art one o' th' false ones. Now I think on thee	
	
    Thou art their soldier and, being bred in broils,	
	
    Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice-	
	
    Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!	
	
    Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell.	
	
    Thou canst not, Cardinal, devise a name	
	
    Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight	
	
    Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not	
	
    Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,	
	
    Thou earth, thou! Speak.	
	
    Thou great defender of this Capitol,	
	
    Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.	
	
    Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.	
	
    Thou hast contrived against the very life	
	
    Thou hast not lov'd.	
	
    Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,	
	
    Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full	
	
    Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour.	
	
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright	
	
    Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,	
	
    Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,	
	
    Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond	
	
    Thou never shalt hear herald any more.                  Exit	
	
    Thou rather, with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,	
	
    Thou seest what's past; go fear thy king withal.	
	
    Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,	
	
    Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,	
	
    Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,	
	
    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.	
	
    Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.	
	
    Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,	
	
    Thou this to hazard needs must intimate	
	
    Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.	
	
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;	
	
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!	
	
    Thou, and thou, and thou. You have serv'd me well,	
	
    Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up	
	
    Though I alone do feel the injury.	
	
    Though I should swear I saw't. 'Tis very much.	
	
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.	
	
    Though every drop of water swear against it,	
	
    Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;	
	
    Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will	
	
    Though it be honest, it is never good	
	
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;	
	
    Though palaces and pyramids do slope	
	
    Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood-	
	
    Though then, God knows, I had no such intent	
	
    Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.      Exit	
	
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.	
	
    Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,	
	
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word	
	
    Three thousand ducats. I'll not answer that,	
	
    Threw many a northward look to see his father	
	
    Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood	
	
    Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier;	
	
    Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley	
	
    Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.	
	
    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground	
	
    Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,	
	
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.	
	
    Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain, of approved	
	
    Thus high, by thy advice	
	
    Thus ornament is but the guiled shore	
	
    Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,	
	
    Thus to excuse yourself.	
	
    Thus would I eat it.                         [Eating a root]	
	
    Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,	
	
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.	
	
    Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,	
	
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,	
	
    Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;	
	
    Thy fortunes. How? that I should murder her?	
	
    Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,	
	
    Thy head, an indirectly, gave direction.	
	
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,	
	
    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;	
	
    Thy lips are warm!	
	
    Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.	
	
    Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear	
	
    Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!	
	
    Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die.	
	
    Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,	
	
    Thy rankest fault-all of them; and require	
	
    Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal	
	
    Thy state of law is bondslave to the law;	
	
    Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers	
	
    Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,	
	
    Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.	
	
    Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.	
	
    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.	
	
    Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love	
	
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.	
	
    Till I were couching with the doctor's clerk.	
	
    Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.	
	
    Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him	
	
    Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops	
	
    Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn	
	
    Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time	
	
    Till supper time alone. While then, God be with you!	
	
    Till that the Duke give order for his burial;	
	
    Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.                 Exit.	
	
    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;	
	
    Till thou have audience.	
	
    Till time lend friends, and friends their helpful swords.	
	
    Till with thy warlike sword, despite of fate,	
	
    Till you hear further from me.	
	
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.	
	
    Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,	
	
    To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.	
	
    To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son, son.	
	
    To Henry's body, and supply his place;	
	
    To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,	
	
    To Owen Glendower; and, dear coz, to you	
	
    To York, to present execution.	
	
    To a most hideous object. Thence it came	
	
    To after-eye him.	
	
    To alter favor ever is to fear.	
	
    To answer all the city.	
	
    To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,	
	
    To any lady that subdues a lord.	
	
    To ask of whence you are. Report it.	
	
    To bathe in fiery floods or to reside	
	
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,	
	
    To be a widow-maker! O, and there	
	
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,	
	
    To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,	
	
    To be his purveyor; but he rides well,	
	
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.	
	
    To be sent after me.	
	
    To be spoke to but by the Recorder.	
	
    To be the post, in hope of his reward.	
	
    To be your Regent in the realm of France.	
	
    To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,	
	
    To beautify thy triumphs, and return	
	
    To beg relief among Rome's enemies;	
	
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,	
	
    To blot out me and put his own son in.	
	
    To break the heart of generosity	
	
    To bring manslaughter into form and set	
	
    To bring you in again.

    To buy his favour, I extend this friendship;	
	
    To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.	
	
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions	
	
    To change a master. O, my fortunes have	
	
    To chase these pagans in those holy fields	
	
    To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,

    To cool a gipsy's lust.	
	
    To counterfeit oppression of such grief

    To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.	
	
    To dim his glory and to stain the track

    To doff their dire distresses.	
	
    To dream on evil or to work my downfall.	
	
    To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee.	
	
    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.	
	
    To enter conquerors, and to proclaim	
	
    To enter our Rome gates. I' th' people's name,	
	
    To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!

    To fright our party.	
	
    To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out	
	
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be

    To give thee answer of thy just demand.	
	
    To give us warrant from the hand of heaven	
	
    To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,	
	
    To grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome	
	
    To grim Necessity; and he and	
	
    To guard a title that was rich before,	
	
    To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.	
	
    To have her name repeated; all her deserving	
	
    To have his pomp, and all what state compounds,	
	
    To have one show worse than the King's and his company.	
	
    To have them fall no more. You some permit	
	
    To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.	
	
    To hear from me you had left Antony,	
	
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-	
	
    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,	
	
    To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father;	
	
    To her unhappy brother Claudio?	
	
    To him or our authorities. For an end,	
	
    To him that for your honour and your state	
	
    To him that worships thee.         [Throwing the money back]	
	
    To his own portion! And what expense by th' hour	
	
    To hold opinion with Pythagoras	
	
    To honour Helen, and to be her knight!                  Exit	
	
    To intercept this inconvenience,	
	
    To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never	
	
    To keep his anger still in motion.

    To know the thing I am forbid to know,	
	
    To lash the rascals naked through the world	
	
    To lay aside life-harming heaviness	
	
    To lead their business; in which regard,	
	
    To leave this keen encounter of our wits,	
	
    To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,	
	
    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,	
	
    To ling'ring sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,	
	
    To look into the bottom of my place:	
	
    To look upon him, till the diminution	
	
    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.	
	
    To make a bloody supper in the Tower.	
	
    To make a stale of me amongst these mates?	
	
    To make divorce of their incorporate league;	
	
    To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,	
	
    To make my end too sudden. Learn, good soul,	
	
    To make that worse, suff'red his kinsman March	
	
    To make the service greater than the god-I	
	
    To make these doubts all even.	
	
    To many lords and ladies; there will be	
	
    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;	
	
    To meet all perils very constantly.	
	
    To meet her new beloved anywhere;	
	
    To mend the petty present, I will piece

    To muddy death.	
	
    To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.	
	
    To no apparent likelihood of breach,	
	
    To offer service to the Duke of Hereford;	
	
    To one that can my part in him advertise.	
	
    To our fast-closed gates; for at this match	
	
    To our own vantage.	
	
    To parley with the sole inheritor	
	
    To part the glories of this happy day.              Exeunt.	
	
    To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,	
	
    To play the broker in mine own behalf;	
	
    To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd moon,	
	
    To present your Highness with the man.

    To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.	
	
    To rouse a lion than to start a hare!	
	
    To save at least the heir of Edward's right.	
	
    To say 'Live, boy.' Ne'er thank thy master. Live;	
	
    To say so to my husband.	
	
    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,	
	
    To see great Hector in his weeds of peace;	
	
    To see him pass on to the Capitol.	
	
    To see inherited my very wishes,	
	
    To see their day and them our fortune give.	
	
    To see thy Antony making his peace,	
	
    To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;	
	
    To seek their fortunes farther than at home,	
	
    To send them to you only for this night;	
	
    To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,	
	
    To set the exact wealth of all our states	
	
    To sheath his knife in us. He is attach'd;	
	
    To show him what a beggar his heart is,	
	
    To show the love and duty that I bear you	
	
    To signify thou cam'st to bite the world;	
	
    To sit with us once more, with better heed	
	
    To smile at scapes and perils overblown.	
	
    To solemnize this day the glorious sun	
	
    To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.	
	
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.	
	
    To spend the time to end it.	
	
    To stand on either part.	
	
    To stay you from election.	
	
    To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts,	
	
    To stormy passion, must perforce decay.	
	
    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph-	
	
    To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,	
	
    To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.	
	
    To swearing and stern looks, diffus'd attire,	
	
    To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.	
	
    To take upon you what is yours. You may

    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;	
	
    To temper poisons for her; still pretending	
	
    To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour	
	
    To th' fire i' th' blood. Be more abstemious,	
	
    To th' rest, and I 'mongst lords be thought a fool.	
	
    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.	
	
    To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire.	
	
    To the direction just.	
	
    To the last hour of act; and then, 'tis thought,	
	
    To the perpetual wink for aye might put	
	
    To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir,	
	
    To thee it shall descend with better quiet,	
	
    To thee, King John, my holy errand is.	
	
    To them for you.	
	
    To think o' th' teen that I have turn'd you to,	
	
    To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.	
	
    To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,	
	
    To this unlook'd-for, unprepared pomp.	
	
    To those which would not know them, and yet must

    To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.	
	
    To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,	
	
    To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo	
	
    To try your taking of a false report, which hath	
	
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.	
	
    To us and to our purposes confin'd-	
	
    To venge me as I may and to put forth	
	
    To visit other places, and come down	
	
    To wag their high tops and to make no noise	
	
    To want the bridegroom when the priest attends	
	
    To wear an undeserved dignity.	
	
    To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,	
	
    To what they were before. My pretty cousin,	
	
    To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?	
	
    To whom God will, there be the victory!	
	
    To whom he gave these words: 'O father Abbot,	
	
    To whom we all rest generally beholding.	
	
    To will this easy match, play'd for a crown?	
	
    To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,	
	
    To wish him wrestle with affection	
	
    To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,	
	
    To you I speak.	
	
    To you, my lord, I come-what lord you will-	
	
    To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit	
	
    To-day how many would have given their honours	
	
    To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.	
	
    To-morrow morning come you to my house,	
	
    To-morrow shall we visit you again.	
	
    To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I	
	
    Together with all famous colleges	
	
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.	
	
    Told of a many thousand warlike French	
	
    Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.	
	
    Too hard an exclamation.	
	
    Too much to know is to know nought but fame;	
	
    Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,	
	
    Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour	
	
    Touching our person seek we no revenge;	
	
    Touching the jointure that your king must make,	
	
    Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling	
	
    Towards which advance the war.	
	
    Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw	
	
    Transported with no worse nor better guard	
	
    Treason, my lord- Lavinia is surpris'd!	
	
    Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,	
	
    Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece	
	
    Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent	
	
    Troyans that thou dream'st not of, the which for sport sake are	
	
    Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.	
	
    Try what my credit can in Venice do;	
	
    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.	
	
    Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.	
	
    Turning the word to sword, and life to death.	
	
    Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting.	
	
    Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone	
	
    Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,	
	
    Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,	
	
    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath	
	
    Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,	
	
    Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms,	
	
    Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now	
	
    Under an oak whose antique root peeps out	
	
    Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather as	
	
    Under the conduct of young Lancaster	
	
    Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'	
	
    Under what title shall I woo for thee	
	
    Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong,	
	
    Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,	
	
    Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both	
	
    Unknown to the beginning.	
	
    Unless by robbing of your friends and us.	
	
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,	
	
    Unless the gods delight in tragedies?	
	
    Unless thou bring'st them with thee.	
	
    Unless to spy my shadow in the sun	
	
    Unless you will accompany me thither.	
	
    Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.	
	
    Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son.	
	
    Unsounded yet, and full of deep deceit.	
	
    Unstaid and skittish in all motions else	
	
    Until a power be rais'd to put them down.	
	
    Until they hear the order of his death.	
	
    Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.	
	
    Unto another lady of esteem.	
	
    Unto his several mistress; which they'll know	
	
    Unto that element; but long it could not be	
	
    Unto the daughter of a worthless king,	
	
    Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes	
	
    Unto your sickness.	
	
    Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;	
	
    Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun-	
	
    Upon Saint Davy's day.	
	
    Upon a lazy bed the livelong day	
	
    Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,	
	
    Upon her great disaster.	
	
    Upon his Irish expedition;	
	
    Upon his party.	
	
    Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come	
	
    Upon my life, I am a lord indeed,	
	
    Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;	
	
    Upon one battle all our liberties.	
	
    Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people	
	
    Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;	
	
    Upon the error that you heard debated.	
	
    Upon the hills adjoining to the city	
	
    Upon the left hand of the even field.	
	
    Upon the parting of your wives and you.	
	
    Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.	
	
    Upon the voice of occupation and	
	
    Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true,	
	
    Upon this land a thousand blessings,	
	
    Upon thy wounds, that kills mine eye and heart!	
	
    Upon whose property and most dear life	
	
    Upon your never-withering banks of flow'rs.	
	
    Us'd intercession to obtain a league,	
	
    Using no other weapon but his name.                     Exit	
	
    Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,	
	
    Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going	
	
    Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,	
	
    Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;	
	
    Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;	
	
    Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.	
	
    Voice, gait, and action, of a gentlewoman;	
	
    Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage,	
	
    Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado, and made Lucifer cuckold,	
	
    Want mercy if I do not join with him!	
	
    Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.	
	
    Warwick, and Huntington, go with the King;	
	
    Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;	
	
    Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity	
	
    Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,	
	
    Was done to death; and more than so, my father,	
	
    Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art,	
	
    Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?	
	
    Was it not so?	
	
    Was near at hand. Ne'er long'd my mother so	
	
    Was never yet for sleep.	
	
    Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,	
	
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.	
	
    Was that my father that went hence so fast?	
	
    Was to be trusted with them.	
	
    Was, for that-young Richard thus remov'd,	
	
    Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;	
	
    We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.	
	
    We are denied access unto his person,	
	
    We are their parents and original.	
	
    We are too open here to argue this;	
	
    We breath'd our counsel; but it pleas'd your Highness	
	
    We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;	
	
    We do exhibit to your Majesty.	
	
    We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,	
	
    We for the worthiest hold the right from both.	
	
    We had not been thus shamefully surpris'd.	
	
    We have as many friends as enemies.	
	
    We have made to endure friends, that you directly	
	
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;	
	
    We here discharge your Grace from being Regent	
	
    We leave you now with better company.	
	
    We may not think the justness of each act	
	
    We met him thitherward; for thence we came,	
	
    We must follow the leaders.	
	
    We must prepare to meet with Caliban.	
	
    We offer fair; take it advisedly.	
	
    We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth	
	
    We see each grain of gravel-I do know	
	
    We shall appear before him.- On, there; pass along.	
	
    We shall chide downright if I longer stay.	
	
    We shall your tawny ground with your red blood	
	
    We sucking on her natural bosom find;	
	
    We tread upon, and never think of it.	
	
    We were enforc'd for safety sake to fly	
	
    We will be short with you. 'Tis his Highness' pleasure	
	
    We will give up our right in Aquitaine,	
	
    We will not from the helm to sit and weep,	
	
    We will, according to your strengths and qualities,	
	
    We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.            Exeunt	
	
    We'll be before our welcome.	
	
    We'll follow them with all the power we have.	
	
    We'll keep him here. Then what is that to him?	
	
    We'll none of that: that have I told my love,	
	
    We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,	
	
    We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,	
	
    We'll walk afoot awhile and ease our legs.	
	
    Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.	
	
    Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,	
	
    Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth be bear it? No. 'Tis	
	
    Weep, wretched man; I'll aid thee tear for tear;	
	
    Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!	
	
    Welcome, Aemilius. What's the news from Rome?	
	
    Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,	
	
    Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;	
	
    Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;	
	
    Well, I will back him straight. O esperance!	
	
    Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;	
	
    Well, of sufferance comes ease.	
	
    Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.	
	
    Were I but where 'tis spoken.	
	
    Were better than a churlish turf of France.	
	
    Were crack'd of kitchen trulls, or his description	
	
    Were feverous and did tremble.	
	
    Were he the butcher of my son, he should	
	
    Were it a casque compos'd by Vulcan's skill

    When English measure backward their own ground	
	
    When I am cold in love to you or yours.	
	
    When I desire it too.	
	
    When I first mov'd you.

    When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,	
	
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames	
	
    When I'll depose I had him in mine arms,	
	
    When adverse foreigners affright my towns	
	
    When all that is within him does condemn

    When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,	
	
    When have I aught exacted at your hands,

    When he sees me go back one foot or flee.             Exeunt	
	
    When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.	
	
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.	
	
    When it is least expected.	
	
    When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones.	
	
    When least in company. Prosper well in this,

    When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.	
	
    When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,	
	
    Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,	
	
    Where I espied the panther fast asleep.	
	
    Where I have hope to see the nuptial	
	
    Where I will write. All may be well enough.	
	
    Where and what time your Majesty shall please.	
	
    Where be thy tenants and thy followers?

    Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!	
	
    Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.	
	
    Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this	
	
    Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,

    Where is best place to make our batt'ry next.	
	
    Where is my Lord of Warwick?	
	
    Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?	
	
    Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?	
	
    Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.	
	
    Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?	
	
    Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,	
	
    Where none will sweat but for promotion,	
	
    Where now remains a sweet reversion.

    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time	
	
    Where we do reign we will alone uphold,	
	
    Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain;	
	
    Where zeal strives to content, and the contents	
	
    Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm'd, rushes	
	
    Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,	
	
    Where, meeting with an old religious man,	
	
    Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself	
	
    Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?	
	
    Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,	
	
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,	
	
    Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.	
	
    Wherein your cunning can assist me much.	
	
    Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,	
	
    Whereof the King my brother was possess'd.	
	
    Whereon, as an offender to your father,	
	
    Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave.	
	
    Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd	
	
    Whether for east or west. The dearth is great;	
	
    Whether they live or die.	
	
    Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.	
	
    Which He hath giv'n for fence impregnable,	
	
    Which I did think with slower foot came on,	
	
    Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor	
	
    Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.	
	
    Which I so often owe; but your ring first,	
	
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.	
	
    Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.	
	
    Which art my nearest and dearest enemy'	
	
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;	
	
    Which by th' interpretation of full time	
	
    Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.	
	
    Which dar'st not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.	
	
    Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.	
	
    Which else would put you to your fortune and	
	
    Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.	
	
    Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me	
	
    Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.	
	
    Which had you rather- that the most just law	
	
    Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe	
	
    Which he did give himself- I know not how,	
	
    Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?	
	
    Which here you urge to prove us enemies,	
	
    Which hurts and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?	
	
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst	
	
    Which is a great way growing on the south,	
	
    Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,	
	
    Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish	
	
    Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!	
	
    Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.	
	
    Which long ere this we offer'd to the King,	
	
    Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;	
	
    Which must approve thee honest. 'If Pisanio	
	
    Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.	
	
    Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,	
	
    Which now came from him.	
	
    Which now we hold at much uncertainty.	
	
    Which of you, if you were a prince's son,	
	
    Which once,' quoth Forrest 'almost chang'd my mind;	
	
    Which parti-coated presence of loose love	
	
    Which scorns a modern invocation.	
	
    Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,	
	
    Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait	
	
    Which should sustain the bound and high curvet	
	
    Which so rous'd up with boist'rous untun'd drums,	
	
    Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,	
	
    Which the commission of thy years and art	
	
    Which then they had to take from 's, to resume	
	
    Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy.'	
	
    Which three till now, never kept seat in one.	
	
    Which tired majesty did make thee offer-	
	
    Which to you shall seem probable, of every	
	
    Which used lives th' executor to be.	
	
    Which was not so before. There's no such thing:	
	
    Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought	
	
    Which well I am assur'd I have not done-	
	
    Which well appeared in his lineaments,	
	
    Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,	
	
    Which would increase his evil. He that depends	
	
    Which you have cited, you must buy that peace	
	
    Which you will wonder at.	
	
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,	
	
    Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.	
	
    Which, by a vision sent to her from heaven,	
	
    Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines	
	
    Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.	
	
    Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,	
	
    Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.	
	
    While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,	
	
    While Philip breathes.	
	
    While it doth study to have what it would,	
	
    While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,	
	
    While you perform your antic round,	
	
    Whiles his most mighty father on a hill	
	
    Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.	
	
    Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace	
	
    Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,	
	
    Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,	
	
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.	
	
    Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief-	
	
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'	
	
    Whither I go, thither shall you go too;	
	
    Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius	
	
    Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.	
	
    Who art thou?	
	
    Who by the hand of France this day hath made	
	
    Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,	
	
    Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,	
	
    Who died within the year of our redemption	
	
    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!	
	
    Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me	
	
    Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;	
	
    Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.	
	
    Who here hath lain this two days buried.	
	
    Who in this dull and long-continued truce	
	
    Who is't can read a woman? Is there more?	
	
    Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that	
	
    Who led me instantly unto his cave,	
	
    Who may I rather challenge for unkindness	
	
    Who now is girdled with a waist of iron	
	
    Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.                 Exeunt	
	
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,	
	
    Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury	
	
    Who strongly hath set footing in this land.	
	
    Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,	
	
    Who to my father was a friend, to me	
	
    Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,	
	
    Who will not change a raven for a dove?	
	
    Who would believe that there were mountaineers,	
	
    Who's there? Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for	
	
    Who, as we hear, are busily in arms.	
	
    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,	
	
    Who, mutually, hath answer'd my affection,	
	
    Who, tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd,	
	
    Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,	
	
    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;	
	
    Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter-	
	
    Whom I would imitate. Consumption catch thee!	
	
    Whom have I injur'd, that ye seek my death?	
	
    Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight,	
	
    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world	
	
    Whom we have left protectors of the King,	
	
    Whom with my bare fists I would execute,	
	
    Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,	
	
    Whose beauty did astonish the survey	
	
    Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.	
	
    Whose deaths are yet unreveng'd. I prithee	
	
    Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch	
	
    Whose far unworthy deputy I am,	
	
    Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides	
	
    Whose great decision hath much blood let forth	
	
    Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave	
	
    Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.	
	
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,	
	
    Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him.	
	
    Whose names are written there, and to them say,	
	
    Whose present grace to present slaves and servants	
	
    Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;	
	
    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,	
	
    Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!	
	
    Whose vows are that no bed-rite shall be paid	
	
    Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,	
	
    Why Somerset should be preferr'd in this.	
	
    Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,	
	
    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe	
	
    Why do we linger thus? I cannot rest	
	
    Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?	
	
    Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?	
	
    Why have I blabb'd? Who shall be true to us,	
	
    Why or for what the nobles were committed	
	
    Why should I war without the walls of Troy	
	
    Why should we in our peevish opposition	
	
    Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider	
	
    Why sweat they under burdens?- let their beds	
	
    Why then, you left me- O, the gods forbid!-	
	
    Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?	
	
    Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,	
	
    Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,	
	
    Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an	
	
    Why, now let me die, for I have liv'd long enough; this is	
	
    Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,	
	
    Why, then you must. Will you put out mine eyes,	
	
    Why, this is just	
	
    Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission	
	
    Will Fortune never come with both hands full,	
	
    Will answer in mine honour.	
	
    Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty	
	
    Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,	
	
    Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.

    Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,	
	
    Will none but Heme the Hunter serve your turn?	
	
    Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.	
	
    Will not permit mine eyes once to behold

    William of Windsor was the seventh and last.	
	
    Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?	
	
    Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for	
	
    Win you this city without stroke or wound;	
	
    Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,	
	
    Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more	
	
    Witch's mummy, maw and gulf	
	
    With Roman swords, and my report was once	
	
    With a disdainful youth; anoint his eyes;	
	
    With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak;	
	
    With all her double vigour, art and nature,	
	
    With all my heart I thank thee for my father!	
	
    With all the choicest music of the kingdom,	
	
    With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.	
	
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver	
	
    With an incensed fire of injuries.	
	
    With any size of words.	
	
    With bleared visages come forth to view	
	
    With brazen din blast you the city's ear;	
	
    With chaces. And we understand him well,	
	
    With colours fairer painted their foul ends.	
	
    With dignities becoming your estates.	
	
    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;	
	
    With every several pleasure in the world;	
	
    With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer	
	
    With fervency drew up.	
	
    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-	
	
    With good advice and little medicine.	
	
    With half that face would he have all my land:	
	
    With harsh-resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,	
	
    With him along is come the mother-queen,	
	
    With his inducement.	
	
    With his tinct gilded thee.	
	
    With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;	
	
    With joyful tidings; and, being better hors'd,	
	
    With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,	
	
    With long continuance in a settled place.	
	
    With manacles through our streets, or else	
	
    With men like you, men of inconstancy.	
	
    With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,	
	
    With my confineless harms.	
	
    With nothing trembles. At some thing it grieves	
	
    With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;	
	
    With one that saw him die, who did report	
	
    With other muniments and petty helps	
	
    With pow'rful policy strengthen themselves	
	
    With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;	
	
    With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had liv'd!	
	
    With ruder terms, such as my wit affords	
	
    With senators on the bench. This is it	
	
    With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.	
	
    With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,	
	
    With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,	
	
    With strife to please you, day exceeding day.	
	
    With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing,	
	
    With such integrity, she did confess	
	
    With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,	
	
    With that harsh, noble, simple nothing-	
	
    With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,	
	
    With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,	
	
    With the least cause these his new honours; which	
	
    With the plebeians swarming at their heels-	
	
    With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,	
	
    With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,	
	
    With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,	
	
    With those of Norway, or did line the rebel	
	
    With threefold love I wish you all these three.	
	
    With too much riches it confound itself;	
	
    With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns,	
	
    With untired spirits and formal constancy.	
	
    With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away	
	
    With well-appointed pow'rs. He is a man	
	
    With whispering and most guilty diligence,	
	
    With whose envenomed and fatal sting	
	
    With words of sooth! O that I were as great	
	
    With your fair honours. You, Lord Archbishop,	
	
    Withal, what I have been, and what I am.	
	
    Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,	
	
    Within rich Pisa's walls as any one	
	
    Within the fore-rank of our articles.	
	
    Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!	
	
    Within two days for this.	
	
    Without annoying me. And there were drawn	
	
    Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words-	
	
    Without more help, could fight this royal battle!	
	
    Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou didst promise	
	
    Without the peril of the Athenian law-	
	
    Without the taste of danger and reproof.	
	
    Witness our too much memorable shame	
	
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,	
	
    Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible:	
	
    Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,	
	
    Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;	
	
    Worthy Cominius, speak.	
	
    Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.	
	
    Would any of the stock of Barrabas	
	
    Would be as heavy to me as odious, but	
	
    Would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices	
	
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib	
	
    Would have reverted to my bow again,	
	
    Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,	
	
    Would make me sad.	
	
    Would move a monster.	
	
    Would not the beggar then forget himself?	
	
    Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff	
	
    Would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me!	
	
    Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;	
	
    Would you imagine, or almost believe-	
	
    Wounds like a leaden sword.	
	
    Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum'd	
	
    Write 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;	
	
    Writes me that man-how dearly ever parted,	
	
    Ye blew the fire that burns ye. Now have at ye!	
	
    Yea, 'gainst th' authority of manners, pray'd you	
	
    Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,	
	
    Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason,	
	
    Yea, overshines ourself.

    Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:	
	
    Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,	
	
    Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value

    You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse	
	
    You are a thousand times a properer man	
	
    You are both sure, and will assist me?	
	
    You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.	
	
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,	
	
    You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,	
	
    You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am	
	
    You bead, you acorn.	
	
    You break not sanctuary in seizing him.	
	
    You cannot revel into dukedoms there.	
	
    You charge not in your spleen a noble person	
	
    You do it her. And so, Sir John, farewell.	
	
    You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans,	
	
    You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,	
	
    You gave me this; but take it, sir, again.	
	
    You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety	
	
    You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;	
	
    You have conspir'd against our royal person,	
	
    You have in manner with your sinful hours	
	
    You have receiv'd your griefs; nor are they such	
	
    You have, by fortune and his Highness' favours,

    You know no more than others! But you frame	
	
    You know that I held Epicurus strong,	
	
    You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience	
	
    You look but on a stool.	
	
    You may as well do anything most hard	
	
    You may my glories and my state depose,	
	
    You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn;	
	
    You must be father to your brother's daughter,	
	
    You must no more call it York Place: that's past:	
	
    You must not put another scandal on him,	
	
    You ne'er kill'd Imogen till now. Help, help!	
	
    You peers, continue this united league.	
	
    You promis'd, when you parted with the King,	
	
    You say that Edward is your brother's son.	
	
    You sent me deputy for Ireland;	
	
    You shall have aid.	
	
    You shall not only take the sacrament	
	
    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,	
	
    You should find better dealing. What's to do?	
	
    You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;	
	
    You stand against anointed majesty!	
	
    You take a precipice for no leap of danger,	
	
    You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.	
	
    You that did void your rheum upon my beard	
	
    You that thus far have come to pity me,	
	
    You urg'd me as a judge; but I had rather	
	
    You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.	
	
    You were best go in.	
	
    You will catch cold, and curse me.	
	
    You will say she did embrace me as a husband,	
	
    You would not make me such an argument.	
	
    You writ to th' Pope against the King; your goodness,	
	
    You'll part away disgrac'd.	
	
    You're kindly welcome.

    Your friar is now your prince. As I was then	
	
    Your greeting is from him, not from the King.

    Your husband, he is gone to save far off,	
	
    Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,	
	
    Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.	
	
    Your looks are pale and wild and do import	
	
    Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift;	
	
    Your mother lives a witness to his vow-	
	
    Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone

    you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully. In Barbary,

    you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.

  AARON. Madam, though Venus govern your desires,

  AARON. Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.	
	
  AARON. Why, then she is the devil's dam;	
	
  ABBOT. A woeful pageant have we here beheld.

  AENEAS. I have been seeking you this hour, my lord.	
	
  AENEAS. Princes, enough, so please you.	
	
  AENEAS. [Within] My lord, is the lady ready?	
	
  AGAMEMNON. Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,	
	
  AGAMEMNON. How?	
	
  AGAMEMNON. No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise,	
	
  AGAMEMNON. This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.	
	
  AGAMEMNON. Which way would Hector have it?	
	
  AGAMEMNON. [Aside] He will be the physician that should be the

  ALONSO. Heard you this, Gonzalo?	
	
  ALONSO. No, no, he's gone.	
	
  ALONSO. What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?	
	
  ALONSO. Why, how now?-Ho, awake!-Why are you drawn?	
	
  AMIENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.	
	
  ANDROMACHE. Cassandra, call my father to persuade.	
	
  ANGELO. And she will speak most bitterly and strange.	
	
  ANGELO. Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?	
	
  ANGELO. I show it most of all when I show justice;	
	
  ANGELO. I will not do't.	
	
  ANGELO. O my dread lord,	
	
  ANGELO. We are all frail.	
	
  ANGELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence	
	
  ANGELO. Your brother is a forfeit of the law,	
	
  ANNE BULLEN, her Maid of Honour, afterwards Queen	
	
  ANNE. Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!	
	
  ANNE. Gentle Master Fenton,	
	
  ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth.	
	
  ANNE. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,	
	
  ANNE. No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,	
	
  ANNE. Now, Master Slender-	
	
  ANNE. Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,	
	
  ANNE. Why, that was he.	
	
  ANTONIO, a merchant of Venice	
	
  ANTONIO.  [Aside]  Mark you this, Bassanio,	
	
  ANTONIO. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.	
	
  ANTONIO. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!	
	
  ANTONIO. Hang, cur; hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker;	
	
  ANTONIO. I am dumb.	
	
  ANTONIO. I'll believe both;	
	
  ANTONIO. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse;	
	
  ANTONIO. Nor I; my spirits are nimble.	
	
  ANTONIO. Ready, so please your Grace.	
	
  ANTONIO. She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells	
	
  ANTONIO. Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;	
	
  ANTONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?	
	
  ANTONIO. Who's there?	
	
  ANTONY. 'Tis spoken well.	
	
  ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.	
	
  ANTONY. Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.	
	
  ANTONY. Cleopatra-	
	
  ANTONY. Dead.	
	
  ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.	
	
  ANTONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;	
	
  ANTONY. How intend you- practis'd?	
	
  ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon	
	
  ANTONY. I must with haste from hence.	
	
  ANTONY. Is he gone?	
	
  ANTONY. Let him that loves me, strike me dead.	
	
  ANTONY. Moon and stars!	
	
  ANTONY. No further, sir.	
	
  ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?	
	
  ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.	
	
  ANTONY. Rarely, rarely!	
	
  ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,	
	
  ANTONY. The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring,	
	
  ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,	
	
  ANTONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,	
	
  ANTONY. We will yet do well.	
	
  ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On!	
	
  ANTONY. Where died she?	
	
  ANTONY. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd	
	
  ANTONY. You have heard much.	
	
  APEMANTUS. Canst not read?	
	
  APEMANTUS. Flow this way! A brave fellow! He keeps his tides well.	
	
  APEMANTUS. Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.	
	
  APEMANTUS. I, that I was	
	
  APEMANTUS. Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!	
	
  APEMANTUS. Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.	
	
  APEMANTUS. The more accursed thou that still omit'st it.	
	
  APEMANTUS. Time to be honest.	
	
  APEMANTUS. Traffic's thy god, and thy god confound thee!	
	
  APEMANTUS. Would thou wouldst burst!	
	
  ARCHBISHOP. 'Tis very true;	
	
  ARCHBISHOP. Here stand, my lords, and send discoverers forth	
	
  ARCHBISHOP. Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace,	
	
  ARIEL. Close by, my master.	
	
  ARIEL. I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;	
	
  ARIEL. Not a hair perish'd;	
	
  ARIEL. That's my noble master!	
	
  ARMADO. A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!	
	
  ARMADO. And so, farewell.	
	
  ARMADO. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,	
	
  ARMADO. I confess both; they are both the varnish of a complete	
	
  ARMADO. I have promised to study three years with the Duke.	
	
  ARMADO. I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton	
	
  ARMADO. Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet touch,	
	
  ARMADO. Peace!	
	
  ARMADO. Sweet bloods, I both may and will.	
	
  ARMADO. This Hector far surmounted Hannibal-	
	
  ARMADO. Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.	
	
  ARTHUR. Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!	
	
  ARTHUR. And will you?	
	
  ARTHUR. O, this will make my mother die with grief!	
	
  ARVIRAGUS. 'Tis true.	
	
  ARVIRAGUS. Let ordinance	
	
  ARVIRAGUS. O' th' floor;	
	
  ARVIRAGUS. So. Begin.	
	
  ARVIRAGUS. Would I had done't,	
	
  AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?	
	
  AUFIDIUS. Go tell the lords o' th' city I am here;	
	
  AUFIDIUS. I have not deserv'd it.	
	
  AUFIDIUS. O, doubt not that!	
	
  AUFIDIUS. Sir, I cannot tell;	
	
  AUFIDIUS. Whence com'st thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name?	
	
  AUMERLE. God save your Grace! I do beseech your Majesty,	
	
  AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?	
	
  AUMERLE. Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.	
	
  AUSTRIA. O that a man should speak those words to me!	
	
  AUSTRIA. Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.	
	
  Abr. No better.	
	
  After a thousand victories once foiled,	
	
  Against this coming end you should prepare,	
	
  Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,	
	
  Alb. Even so. Cover their faces.	
	
  Alb. I'll overtake you.- Speak.	
	
  Alb. Run, run, O, run!	
	
  Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.	
	
  Alb. Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!	
	
  Alb. What's the matter, sir?	
	
  All. Lights, lights, lights!	
	
  Although I swear it to my self alone.	
	
  An Apothecary.	
	
  And I a tyrant have no leisure taken	
	
  And all my honest faith in thee is lost.	
	
  And all that are assembled in this place	
	
  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,	
	
  And by a part of all thy glory live:	
	
  And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,	
	
  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,	
	
  And each (though enemies to either's reign)	
	
  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,	
	
  And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,	
	
  And gives thy pen both skill and argument.	
	
  And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er	
	
  And ill it doth beseem your holiness	
	
  And in this change is my invention spent,	
	
  And kept unused the user so destroys it:	
	
  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.	
	
  And much different from the man he was;	
	
  And now he's there, past thought of human reason.	
	
  And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,	
	
  And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,	
	
  And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,	
	
  And soon to you, as you to me then tendered	
	
  And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,	
	
  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:	
	
  And that I did deny my wife and house.	
	
  And that your love taught it this alchemy?	
	
  And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.	
	
  And this it was, for other means was none:	
	
  And thou away, the very birds are mute.	
	
  And to the painted banquet bids my heart:	
	
  And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,	
	
  And with you take the chain, and bid my wife	
	
  And worse essays proved thee my best of love.	
	
  And you in Grecian tires are painted new:	
	
  And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,	
	
  Ant. And shall, or some of us will smart for it.	
	
  Ant. To tell you true, I counterfeit him.	
	
  Ant. Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.	
	
  Arch. No, Mortimer is not there.	
	
  Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar'st.	
	
  As after sunset fadeth in the west,	
	
  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,	
	
  As soon as think the place where he would be.	
	
  As you love strokes, so jest with me again.	
	
  At eighteen years became inquisitive

  BANQUO, Thane of Lochaber, a general in the King's army	
	
  BANQUO. Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven,	
	
  BANQUO. Look to the lady.	
	
  BANQUO. To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?	
	
  BANQUO. [Aside to Macbeth.] That, trusted home,	
	
  BAPTISTA. Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,	
	
  BAPTISTA. Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.	
	
  BAPTISTA. Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.	
	
  BAPTISTA. Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!	
	
  BAPTISTA. What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.	
	
  BAPTISTA. Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?	
	
  BARDOLPH.  [ Within]  Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my master.	
	
  BARDOLPH. Away, you rogue.	
	
  BARDOLPH. Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife. Good Corporal, be	
	
  BARDOLPH. I beseech you, which is Justice Shallow?	
	
  BARDOLPH. O joyful day!	
	
  BARDOLPH. Well said; th'art a good fellow.	
	
  BARDOLPH. You Banbury cheese!	
	
  BARNARDINE. [ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.	
	
  BASSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife	
	
  BASSANIO. Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me?	
	
  BASSANIO. If it please you to dine with us.	
	
  BASSANIO. No, that were pity;	
	
  BASSANIO. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;	
	
  BASSANIO. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,	
	
  BASSANIO. Yes; here I tender it for him in the court;	
	
  BASSIANUS, brother to Saturninus	
	
  BASSIANUS. The King my brother shall have notice of this.	
	
  BASTARD. 'Tis true-to hurt his master, no man else.	
	
  BASTARD. As faithfully as I deny the devil.	
	
  BASTARD. By all the blood that ever fury breath'd,	
	
  BASTARD. Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder,	
	
  BASTARD. Hubert, I think.	
	
  BASTARD. Madam, an if my brother had my shape	
	
  BASTARD. Now, by this light, were I to get again,	
	
  BASTARD. Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,	
	
  BASTARD. The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,	
	
  BASTARD. Will't not be?	
	
  BATES. Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be	
	
  BEDFORD. He is as full of valour as of kindness;	
	
  BEDFORD. Not to be gone from hence; for once I read	
	
  BELARIUS, a banished lord, disguised under the name of Morgan	
	
  BELARIUS. How you speak!	
	
  BELARIUS. My ingenious instrument!	
	
  BELARIUS. Not too hot.	
	
  BELARIUS. Sir,	
	
  BELARIUS. What's your name?	
	
  BEROWNE. A dangerous law against gentility.	
	
  BEROWNE. A right description of our sport, my lord.	
	
  BEROWNE. And I, forsooth, in love; I, that have been love's whip;	
	
  BEROWNE. Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.	
	
  BEROWNE. For the following, sir?	
	
  BEROWNE. I cannot stay thanksgiving.                [Retiring]	
	
  BEROWNE. Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue.	
	
  BEROWNE. Necessity will make us all forsworn	
	
  BEROWNE. O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:	
	
  BEROWNE. Peace; for I will not have to do with you.	
	
  BEROWNE. So study evermore is over-shot.	
	
  BEROWNE. That's too long for a play.	
	
  BEROWNE. This is not so well as I look'd for, but the best that	
	
  BEROWNE. Well said, old mocker; I must needs be friends with thee.	
	
  BEROWNE. White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.	
	
  BEROWNE. Would that do it good?	
	
  BEROWNE. Your wit 's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.	
	
  BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it.	
	
  BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides rogue!	
	
  BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir,	
	
  BERTRAM. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it	
	
  BERTRAM. It is an honour 'longing to our house,	
	
  BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?	
	
  BERTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me!	
	
  BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord.	
	
  BERTRAM. What of him?	
	
  BERTRAM. You are deceiv'd, my lord; she never saw it.	
	
  BIANCA.                          But that you do not love me.	
	
  BIANCA. And may you prove, sir, master of your art!	
	
  BIANCA. Is it for him you do envy me so?	
	
  BIANCA. Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?	
	
  BIANCA. Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong	
	
  BIONDELLO. Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound	
	
  BIONDELLO. I have seen them in the church together. God send 'em	
	
  BIONDELLO. Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving	
	
  BIONDELLO. Why, sir, he comes not.	
	
  BISHOP OF ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?	
	
  BLUNT. He hath no friends but what are friends for fear,	
	
  BOATSWAIN. Here, master; what cheer?	
	
  BOATSWAIN. What, must our mouths be cold?	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Bring forth these men.	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Have thy desire.	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. I thought you had been willing to resign.	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Lords, you that here are under our arrest,	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy.	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. On Wednesday next we solemnly set down	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. These differences shall all rest under gage	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. What says his Majesty?	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. With all my heart	
	
  BOTH MURTHERERS. We are resolved, my lord.	
	
  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, well, sir, well.	
	
  BOTH. Sir, good success!

  BOY. It hath struck.	
	
  BOYET. A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.

  BOYET. I fear too much rubbing; good-night, my good owl.	
	
  BOYET. My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,	
	
  BOYET. She hears herself.	
	
  BOYET. The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen	
	
  BOYET. True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen;	
	
  BOYET. With libbard's head on knee.	
	
  BRABANTIO.                  God be with you! I have done.	
	
  BRABANTIO.              Humbly I thank your Grace.	
	
  BRABANTIO. O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?	
	
  BRABANTIO. What, have you lost your wits?	
	
  BRITAINE. Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!	
	
  BRUTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.	
	
  BRUTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.	
	
  BRUTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.	
	
  BRUTUS. By your pardon,	
	
  BRUTUS. Come.	
	
  BRUTUS. Could you not have told him-	
	
  BRUTUS. Everything is well.	
	
  BRUTUS. Go to, you are not, Cassius.	
	
  BRUTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.	
	
  BRUTUS. He is welcome too.	
	
  BRUTUS. How? I inform them!	
	
  BRUTUS. I say you are not.	
	
  BRUTUS. If it were so-	
	
  BRUTUS. It was his word. O, he would miss it rather	
	
  BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth	
	
  BRUTUS. Manifest treason!	
	
  BRUTUS. Not I.	
	
  BRUTUS. Now we have shown our power,	
	
  BRUTUS. Peace then, no words.	
	
  BRUTUS. Remember March, the ides of March remember.	
	
  BRUTUS. Sheathe your dagger.	
	
  BRUTUS. Stand, ho!	
	
  BRUTUS. The present wars devour him! He is grown	
	
  BRUTUS. We do it not alone, sir.	
	
  BRUTUS. We'll hear no more.	
	
  BRUTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?	
	
  BRUTUS. Why?	
	
  BRUTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?	
	
  BRUTUS. You see how he intends to use the people.	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time,	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Hastings, and Edward's children, Grey, and	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. I will, my lord, and doubt not so to deal	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow, then, we will attend your Grace;	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. We wait upon your Grace.                    Exeunt	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Who did guide-	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.	
	
  BULLCALF. A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught with	
	
  BURGUNDY. Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.	
	
  BURGUNDY. My vows are equal partners with thy vows.	
	
  BUSHY. 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.	
	
  BUSHY. Thither will I with you; for little office	
	
  BUTTS.  [Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am glad	
	
  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.	
	
  Bar. Case ye, case ye! On with your vizards! There's money of the	
	
  Bard. Do, my lord.	
	
  Bard. Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.	
	
  Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;	
	
  Beat. 'Then' is spoken. Fare you well now. And yet, ere I go, let	
	
  Beat. Benedictus? why benedictus? You have some moral in this	
	
  Beat. Do not you love me?	
	
  Beat. How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am	
	
  Beat. In faith, I will go.	
	
  Beat. It is not seen enough. You should wear it in your cap. By my	
	
  Beat. O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner	
	
  Beat. Sweet Hero! she is wrong'd, she is sland'red, she is undone.	
	
  Beat. What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?	
	
  Beat. Will you not tell me who told you so?	
	
  Beat. You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine	
	
  Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?	
	
  Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,	
	
  Being your slave what should I do but tend,	
	
  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.	
	
  Ben. Groan? Why, no;	
	
  Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.	
	
  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.	
	
  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.	
	
  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?	
	
  Bene. And I do with an eye of love requite her.	
	
  Bene. Count Claudio?	
	
  Bene. Gallants, I am not as I have been.	
	
  Bene. I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and	
	
  Bene. I will not desire that.	
	
  Bene. If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a	
	
  Bene. May a man do it?	
	
  Bene. O God, sir, here's a dish I love not! I cannot endure my Lady	
	
  Bene. That I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she	
	
  Bene. The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear	
	
  Bene. Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.	
	
  Bene. Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise,	
	
  Bene. [aside] An he had been a dog that should have howl'd thus,	
	
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.	
	
  Ber. Long live the King!	
	
  Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan	
	
  Between you I shall have a holy head.	
	
  Blunt. I come with gracious offers from the King,	
	
  Bora. And that is Claudio. I know him by his bearing.	
	
  Bora. Master Constable--	
	
  Bora. Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is?	
	
  Bora. Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio; but the devil my	
	
  Both truth and beauty on my love depends:	
	
  Boy. I am here already, sir.	
	
  Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a father	
	
  But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?	
	
  But bears it out even to the edge of doom:	
	
  But ere they came-O, let me say no more!	
	
  But here must end the story of my life;	
	
  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,	
	
  But not a thousand marks between you both.	
	
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you	
	
  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,	
	
  But to our honour's great disparagement,	
	
  But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes	
	
  But, soft, my door is lock'd; go bid them let us in.	
	
  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:	
	
  By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.	
	
  CADE. And you that love the commons follow me.	
	
  CADE. Ay, there's the question; but I say 'tis true.	
	
  CADE. Here's a villain!	
	
  CADE. Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name, or hast thou a	
	
  CADE. Nay, then he is a conjurer.	
	
  CADE. Valiant I am.	
	
  CADE. Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?	
	
  CAESAR. Bid her have good heart.	
	
  CAESAR. Cleopatra, know	
	
  CAESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;	
	
  CAESAR. Ha! Who calls?	
	
  CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.	
	
  CAESAR. Let him appear that's come from Antony.	
	
  CAESAR. Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve	
	
  CAESAR. Nor must not then be yielded to in this.	
	
  CAESAR. Take your time.	
	
  CAESAR. The cause is in my will: I will not come,	
	
  CAESAR. What man is that?	
	
  CAESAR. Which soon he granted,	
	
  CAESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not	
	
  CAIUS MARCIUS, afterwards CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS	
	
  CAIUS. Ay, dat is very good! excellent!	
	
  CAIUS. Clapper-de-claw! Vat is dat?	
	
  CAIUS. I know vat I have to do; adieu.	
	
  CAIUS. Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere	
	
  CAIUS. You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby.	
	
  CALIBAN.   [ Within]  There's wood enough within.	
	
  CALIBAN. Ha, ha, ha!	
	
  CALIBAN. I will have none on't. We shall lose our time,	
	
  CALIBAN. No more dams I'll make for fish;	
	
  CALIBAN. Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou;	
	
  CALPURNIA. What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?	
	
  CALPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;	
	
  CAMPEIUS. They will not stick to say you envied him	
	
  CANIDIUS. Who's his lieutenant, hear you?	
	
  CANTERBURY. Therefore doth heaven divide	
	
  CAPHIS. Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus.	
	
  CAPTAIN. Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!	
	
  CAPTAIN. He's alive, my lord.	
	
  CAPUCIUS, Ambassador from the Emperor Charles V	
	
  CARDINAL. Believe me, cousin Gloucester,	
	
  CARDINAL. Let me be blessed for the peace I make	
	
  CARDINAL. So, there goes our Protector in a rage.	
	
  CARDINAL. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] Medice, teipsum;	
	
  CASCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth	
	
  CASCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?	
	
  CASCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was	
	
  CASCA. Why, for that too.	
	
  CASCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!	
	
  CASSANDRA. O, farewell, dear Hector!	
	
  CASSIO.                  Yet, I beseech you,	
	
  CASSIO.             Most heathenish and most gross!	
	
  CASSIO. 'Zounds! You rogue! You rascal!	
	
  CASSIO. Good night, honest Iago.                              Exit.	
	
  CASSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!	
	
  CASSIO. I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a	
	
  CASSIO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!	
	
  CASSIO. None in the world; nor do I know the man.	
	
  CASSIO. Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold	
	
  CASSIO. That's one of them.	
	
  CASSIO. What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!	
	
  CASSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.	
	
  CASSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,	
	
  CASSIUS. Casca, by your voice.	
	
  CASSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!	
	
  CASSIUS. Good night, my lord.	
	
  CASSIUS. I denied you not.	
	
  CASSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:	
	
  CASSIUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.	
	
  CASSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,	
	
  CASSIUS. Pindarus,	
	
  CASSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,	
	
  CASSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,	
	
  CASSIUS. What, durst not tempt him?	
	
  CASSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life	
	
  CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince	
	
  CATESBY. It's supper-time, my lord;	
	
  CATESBY. The Princes both make high account of you-	
	
  CELIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes	
	
  CELIA. Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.	
	
  CELIA. Gentle cousin,	
	
  CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;	
	
  CELIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,	
	
  CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her	
	
  CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love	
	
  CELIA. Something browner than Judas's.	
	
  CELIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday	
	
  CELIA. Will you go, coz?	
	
  CELIA. With his eyes full of anger.	
	
  CENTURION. Let's hear him, for the things he speaks	
	
  CHAMBERLAIN. Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd	
	
  CHAMBERLAIN. It seems the marriage with his brother's wife	
	
  CHAMBERLAIN. Sir Thomas,	
	
  CHAMBERLAIN. Well said, my lord.	
	
  CHANCELLOR. Speak to the business, master secretary;	
	
  CHARLES. Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.	
	
  CHARLES. Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.	
	
  CHARLES. So we be rid of them, do with them what thou	
	
  CHARLES. Stay, stay thy hands; thou art an Amazon,	
	
  CHARMIAN. 'Twas merry when	
	
  CHARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:	
	
  CHARMIAN. Good your Highness, patience.	
	
  CHARMIAN. Madam, I will.	
	
  CHARMIAN. O Cleopatra! thou art taken, Queen!	
	
  CHARMIAN. O, quietness, lady!	
	
  CHARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;	
	
  CHATILLON. Philip of France, in right and true behalf	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. How now, Sir John! what, are you brawling here?	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sure he is, to the hearing of anything good.	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. There is not a white hair in your face but should	
	
  CHIEF JUSTICE. You shall have letters of me presently.	
	
  CHIRON. An 'twere my cause, I should go hang myself.	
	
  CHIRON. Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son.	
	
  CHIRON. Show me a villain that hath done a rape,	
	
  CHIRON. Thou hast undone our mother.	
	
  CHORUS. Thus with imagin'd wing our swift scene flies,	
	
  CINNA. Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.	
	
  CINNA. I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.	
	
  CINNA. What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I	
	
  CITIZEN. That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,	
	
  CLARENCE. As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.	
	
  CLARENCE. Doth the King call?	
	
  CLARENCE. I mind to tell him plainly what I think.	
	
  CLARENCE. In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,	
	
  CLARENCE. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,	
	
  CLARENCE. To London, all in post; and, as I guess,	
	
  CLARENCE. Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.	
	
  CLARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game; how true he	
	
  CLAUDIO. Come, officer, away.                           Exeunt	
	
  CLAUDIO. I have done so, but he's not to be found.	
	
  CLAUDIO. Sweet sister, let me live.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. 'Tis sweating labour	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Ah, stand by!	
	
  CLEOPATRA. By sea! What else?	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Give me some music- music, moody food	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Hear the ambassadors.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!	
	
  CLEOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. If it be love indeed, tell me how much.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Let me sit down. O Juno!	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors	
	
  CLEOPATRA. No, I will not.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Th'art an honest man.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. That head, my lord?	
	
  CLEOPATRA. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. What's your name?	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true,	
	
  CLERK OF CHATHAM	
	
  CLIFFORD. Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.	
	
  CLIFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?	
	
  CLIFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here	
	
  CLIFFORD. This is my King, York, I do not mistake;	
	
  CLIFFORD. What say ye, countrymen? Will ye relent	
	
  CLOTEN. 'His garment'!	
	
  CLOTEN. Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing	
	
  CLOTEN. Do you call me fool?	
	
  CLOTEN. I love and hate her; for she's fair and royal,	
	
  CLOTEN. Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation	
	
  CLOTEN. Receive it friendly; but from this time forth	
	
  CLOTEN. This is no answer.	
	
  CLOTEN. Where is she, sir? Come nearer.	
	
  CLOTEN. Your lady's person; is she ready?	
	
  CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.	
	
  CLOWN. But as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in	
	
  CLOWN. But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could	
	
  CLOWN. Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest	
	
  CLOWN. How much money must I have?	
	
  CLOWN. I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for	
	
  CLOWN. I must catechize you for it, madonna.	
	
  CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades'	
	
  CLOWN. Madman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness but	
	
  CLOWN. Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.	
	
  CLOWN. No, sir, I live by the church.	
	
  CLOWN. O, thereby hangs a tail.	
	
  CLOWN. Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let	
	
  CLOWN. Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should	
	
  CLOWN. Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my	
	
  CLOWN. Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in't; and	
	
  CLOWN. Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that word	
	
  CLOWN. [Sings] His eyes do show his days are almost done.	
	
  CLOWN. [Sings] Sir Toby, there you lie.	
	
  COLVILLE. I am a knight sir; and my name is Colville of the Dale.	
	
  COMINIUS. Ever right.	
	
  COMINIUS. Go we to our tent.	
	
  COMINIUS. If!	
	
  COMINIUS. O, ay, what else?	
	
  COMINIUS. That is the way to lay the city flat,	
	
  COMINIUS. Yet one time he did call me by my name.	
	
  CONSPIRATORS, With Aufidius	
	
  CONSTABLE. I stay but for my guidon. To the field!	
	
  CONSTABLE. Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he car'd not	
	
  CONSTABLE. To horse, you gallant Princes! straight to horse!	
	
  CONSTABLE. You have shot over.	
	
  CONSTANCE. He talks to me that never had a son.	
	
  CONSTANCE. O fair return of banish'd majesty!	
	
  CONSTANCE. What should he say, but as the Cardinal?	
	
  CORIN. Assuredly the thing is to be sold.	
	
  CORIN. Nay, I hope.	
	
  CORIOLANUS.  [To his wife and mother]  Your hand, and yours.	
	
  CORIOLANUS. A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Away!	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Direct me, if it be your will,	
	
  CORIOLANUS. How? no more!	
	
  CORIOLANUS. I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun	
	
  CORIOLANUS. I would they were barbarians, as they are,	
	
  CORIOLANUS. May I change these garments?	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Most sweet voices!	
	
  CORIOLANUS. On fair ground	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Say then; 'tis true, I ought so.	
	
  CORIOLANUS. The fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people!	
	
  CORIOLANUS. To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!'	
	
  CORIOLANUS. What do you prate of service?	
	
  CORIOLANUS. What's this?	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Your enigma?	
	
  CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do suspect you, madam;	
	
  COSTARD. Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor wench	
	
  COSTARD. God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?	
	
  COSTARD. I'll do it in my shirt.	
	
  COSTARD. My sweet ounce of man's flesh, my incony Jew!	
	
  COSTARD. Not a word of Costard yet.	
	
  COSTARD. Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.	
	
  COSTARD. The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.	
	
  COSTARD. Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full	
	
  COSTARD. With a wench.	
	
  COUNTESS. And to be a soldier?	
	
  COUNTESS. Dost thou believe't?	
	
  COUNTESS. He blushes, and 'tis it.	
	
  COUNTESS. If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.	
	
  COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me?	
	
  COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.	
	
  COUNTESS. To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in	
	
  COUNTESS. Well, now.	
	
  COUNTESS. With all my heart, and think me honoured	
	
  CRANMER.  [Aside]  'Tis Butts,	
	
  CRANMER. God and your Majesty	
	
  CRANMER. Let me speak, sir,	
	
  CRESSIDA. 'Tis just to each of them: he is himself.	
	
  CRESSIDA. And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle	
	
  CRESSIDA. Be those with swords?	
	
  CRESSIDA. Good morrow, then.	
	
  CRESSIDA. Hard to seem won; but I was won, my lord,	
	
  CRESSIDA. I must then to the Grecians?	
	
  CRESSIDA. In faith, I do not. Come hither once again.	
	
  CRESSIDA. No matter.	
	
  CRESSIDA. Nor nothing monstrous neither?	
	
  CRESSIDA. O, you shall be expos'd, my lord, to dangers	
	
  CRESSIDA. So let it now; for it has been a great while going by.	
	
  CRESSIDA. Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.	
	
  CRESSIDA. Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend	
	
  CRESSIDA. Who were those went by?	
	
  CRESSIDA. Without the rack.	
	
  CRESSIDA. You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;	
	
  CROMWELL. My mind gave me,	
	
  CROMWELL. The heaviest and the worst	
	
  CURTIS	
	
  CURTIS. I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?	
	
  CURTIS. Who knows not that?	
	
  CYMBELINE. Does the world go round?	
	
  CYMBELINE. I stand on fire.	
	
  CYMBELINE. Marry, the gods forfend!	
	
  CYMBELINE. O disloyal thing,	
	
  CYMBELINE. O, what am I?	
	
  CYMBELINE. The exile of her minion is too new;	
	
  CYMBELINE. Thou weep'st and speak'st.	
	
  CYMBELINE. What, art thou mad?	
	
  Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,	
	
  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,	
	
  Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?	
	
  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!

  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,	
	
  Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,	
	
  Fool. An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question,

  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;	
	
  Friar. Have comfort, lady.	
	
  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!	
	
  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.	
	
  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.	
	
  Friar. To do what, signior?	
	
  Friar. Yea, wherefore should she not?	
	
  From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!

  GLOUCESTER. All happiness unto my lord the King!

  GLOUCESTER. And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. By so much is the wonder in extremes.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Catesby, o'erlook the walls.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. For God's sake, take away this captive scold.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd

  GLOUCESTER. Well, my good lord, and as the only means	
	
  GLOUCESTER. What news abroad?	
	
  GLOUCESTER. What, would you have my weapon, little

  GRATIANO. He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.	
	
  GRATIANO. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away	
	
  GRATIANO. Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,	
	
  GRATIANO. The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.	
	
  GRATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe,

  GRUMIO. I fear it is too choleric a meat.	
	
  GRUMIO. My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,	
	
  GRUMIO. What's that to thee?	
	
  GRUMIO. Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold.	
	
  GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS. Stand, stand, and fight!

  HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.	
	
  HELENA. O weary night, O long and tedious night,	
	
  HELENA. Sir, I can nothing say

  HOSTESS. Faith, you said so before.	
	
  HOSTESS. Here's a goodly tumult! I'll forswear keeping house afore	
	
  HOSTESS. I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an excellent

  HOSTESS. You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?	
	
  HUBERT. Do but hear me, sir.	
	
  HUBERT. Here is your hand and seal for what I did.	
	
  HUBERT. Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you.

  Ham. Are you fair?	
	
  Ham. Between who?	
	
  Ham. Come on, sir.	
	
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-	
	
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!	
	
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?	
	
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,	
	
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man	
	
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.	
	
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-	
	
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?	
	
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your	
	
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.	
	
  Ham. Into my grave?	
	
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.	
	
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,	
	
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;	
	
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.	
	
  Ham. Nothing.	
	
  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?	
	
  Ham. Of him, sir.	
	
  Ham. Pale or red?	
	
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a	
	
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave	
	
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.	
	
  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?	
	
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for

  He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,	
	
  He rush'd into my house and took perforce	
	
  Herein you war against your reputation,

  Hero. Indeed he hath an excellent good name.	
	
  Hero. None, my lord.	
	
  Hero. O, that exceeds, they say.	
	
  Hero. Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,	
	
  Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.	
	
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.	
	
  Hor. E'en so.	
	
  Hor. Friends to this ground.	
	
  Hor. I did very well note him.	
	
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.	
	
  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!	
	
  Hor. No, by no means!	
	
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,	
	
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.	
	
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,	
	
  Host. An old man.	
	
  Host. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at door

  Hot. I think there's no man speaks better Welsh. I'll to dinner.	
	
  Hot. Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.	
	
  Hot. No more, no more! Worse than the sun in March,	
	
  Hot. Of York, is it not?	
	
  Hot. So are the horses of the enemy,	
	
  Hot. Well, I am school'd. Good manners be your speed!	
	
  Hot. Where?	
	
  How can I then be elder than thou art?	
	
  How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted	
	
  How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,	
	
  I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;	
	
  I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument	
	
  I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought

  IAGO. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!	
	
  IAGO. I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,

  IAGO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.	
	
  IAGO. Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me	
	
  IAGO. My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.	
	
  IAGO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;	
	
  IAGO. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.	
	
  IAGO. She never yet was foolish that was fair,	
	
  IAGO. Some wine, ho!	
	
  IAGO. To have a foolish wife.	
	
  IAGO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.

  ISABELLA. But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,	
	
  ISABELLA. Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.	
	
  ISABELLA. I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't;

  ISABELLA. Yes, brother, you may live:	
	
  If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,	
	
  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,	
	
  If every one knows us, and we know none,	
	
  If my dear love were but the child of state,	
	
  If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,	
	
  If we obey them not, this will ensue:	
	
  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,	
	
  In our two loves there is but one respect,

  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,	
	
  MENELAUS. An odd man, lady? Every man is odd.	
	
  MENENIUS. A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep	
	
  MENENIUS. All's well, and might have been much better	
	
  MENENIUS. Do not stand upon't.	
	
  MENENIUS. For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest,	
	
  MENENIUS. He's right noble;	
	
  MENENIUS. Hear me one word; beseech you, Tribunes,	
	
  MENENIUS. I will make my very house reel to-night. A letter for me?	
	
  MENENIUS. It then remains	
	
  MENENIUS. No; I'll not meddle.	
	
  MENENIUS. Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you; you shall	
	
  MENENIUS. Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall	
	
  MENENIUS. Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me	
	
  MENENIUS. That's worthily	
	
  MENENIUS. This is good news.	
	
  MENENIUS. Well, well, no more of that.	
	
  MENENIUS. Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of	
	
  MENTEITH. The Wood of Birnam.	
	
  MERCHANT. A most incomparable man; breath'd, as it were,	
	
  MESSALA,      "     "    "	
	
  MESSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?	
	
  MESSENGER. 'Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done,	
	
  MESSENGER. Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship	
	
  MESSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.	
	
  MESSENGER. Good madam, patience.	
	
  MESSENGER. I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.	
	
  MESSENGER. Madam, it is.	
	
  MESSENGER. My lord, he doth deny to come.	
	
  MESSENGER. No treachery, but want of men and money.	
	
  MESSENGER. Round even to faultiness.	
	
  MESSENGER. The English are embattl'd, you French peers.	
	
  MESSENGER. The citizens of Corioli have issued	
	
  MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four.	
	
  MESSENGER. Within this mile and half.	
	
  METELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,	
	
  MIRANDA. 'Tis far off,	
	
  MIRANDA. Beseech you, father!	
	
  MIRANDA. I might call him	
	
  MIRANDA. O, the heavens!	
	
  MIRANDA. You have often	
	
  MIRANDA. You look wearily.	
	
  MONTAGUE. Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.	
	
  MONTANO.                 If that the Turkish fleet	
	
  MONTANO. I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.	
	
  MONTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm,	
	
  MONTJOY. My master's mind.	
	
  MORTIMER. With silence, nephew, be thou politic;	
	
  MORTON. I am sorry I should force you to believe	
	
  MOTH. A message well sympathiz'd- a horse to be ambassador for an	
	
  MOTH. Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.	
	
  MOTH. Come, you transgressing slave, away.	
	
  MOTH. Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about your	
	
  MOTH. Negligent student! learn her by heart.	
	
  MOTH. Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe	
	
  MOTH. Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?	
	
  MOTH. You are too swift, sir, to say so:	
	
  MOULDY. Here, an't please you.	
	
  MOWBRAY. My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;	
	
  MOWBRAY. There is a thing within my bosom tells me	
	
  MOWBRAY. Your Grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.	
	
  MRS. FORD. Do not betray me, sir; I fear you love Mistress	
	
  MRS. FORD. How near is he, Mistress Page?	
	
  MRS. FORD. I think my husband hath some special suspicion	
	
  MRS. FORD. Marry, this is our device-	
	
  MRS. FORD. No, certainly.  [Aside to her]  Speak louder.	
	
  MRS. FORD. We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry	
	
  MRS. FORD. Well, I do, then; yet, I say, I could show you to	
	
  MRS. FORD. Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the	
	
  MRS. OVERDONE. Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.	
	
  MRS. OVERDONE. Well, well! there's one yonder arrested and carried	
	
  MRS. PAGE. A puff'd man?	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Come, to the forge with it then; shape it. I	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the	
	
  MRS. PAGE. I Will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Indeed?	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Nay, but he'll be here presently; let's go dress	
	
  MRS. PAGE. So will I; if he come under my hatches, I'll never	
	
  MRS. PAGE. We will do it; let him be sent for to-morrow	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Why, look where he comes; and my good man	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Why, then, you are utterly sham'd, and he's but	
	
  MUSTARDSEED. Ready.	
	
  Magnificoes of Venice, Officers of the Court of Justice,	
	
  Making dead wood more blest than living lips,	
	
  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.	
	
  Mar. Look with what courteous action	
	
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.	
	
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.	
	
  Marg. And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit but hurt	
	
  Marg. So would not I for your own sake, for I have many ill	
	
  Marg. Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.	
	
  Mer. A sail, a sail!	
	
  Mer. By my heel, I care not.	
	
  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay	
	
  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the	
	
  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.	
	
  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?	
	
  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings	
	
  Mess. I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.	
	
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:	
	
  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,	
	
  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:	
	
  Mistress Quickly, hostess of the Boar's Head in Eastcheap.	
	
  Montague, heads of two houses at variance with each other.	
	
  Mort. O, I am ignorance itself in this!	
	
  Mother. What is the matter?	
	
  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:	
	
  My life being made of four, with two alone,	
	
  My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,	
	
  My saucy bark (inferior far to his)	
	
  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,	
	
  My wife-but, I protest, without desert-	
	
  NATHANIEL. Peter, didst ever see the like?	
	
  NATHANIEL. Videsne quis venit?	
	
  NERISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,	
	
  NERISSA. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?	
	
  NERISSA. Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight;	
	
  NESTOR. A woman of quick sense.	
	
  NESTOR. And in the imitation of these twain-	
	
  NESTOR. Our noble general, do not do so.	
	
  NESTOR. Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument	
	
  NICANOR, a Roman	
	
  NORFOLK. A good direction, warlike sovereign.	
	
  NORFOLK. Believe it, this is true:	
	
  NORFOLK. It's heaven's will;	
	
  NORFOLK. Marry, is't.	
	
  NORFOLK. Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Be it with resolution, then, to fight.	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. What was his reason?	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.	
	
  NURSE. Cornelia the midwife and myself;	
	
  NYM. He was gotten in drink. Is not the humour conceited?	
	
  NYM. I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but adieu.	
	
  NYM. The King is a good king, but it must be as it may; he passes	
	
  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,	
	
  Nay if you read this line, remember not,	
	
  No it was builded far from accident,	
	
  No, I am that I am, and they that level	
	
  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,	
	
  Nor services to do till you require.	
	
  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,	
	
  North. Imagination of some great exploit	
	
  Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.	
	
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,	
	
  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.	
	
  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!	
	
  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.	
	
  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?	
	
  Nurse. Marry, bachelor,	
	
  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.	
	
  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!	
	
  Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.	
	
  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.	
	
  O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,	
	
  O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,	
	
  O let my looks be then the eloquence,	
	
  O that our night of woe might have remembered	
	
  OBERON.       Stand aside. The noise they make	
	
  OBERON. How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,	
	
  OBERON. How long within this wood intend you stay?	
	
  OBERON. This falls out better than I could devise.	
	
  OCTAVIA. Good my lord,	
	
  OCTAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.	
	
  OCTAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.	
	
  OCTAVIUS. You may do your will,	
	
  OLD ATHENIAN. This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,	
	
  OLD LADY. I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring	
	
  OLIVER. And you, fair sister.                             Exit	
	
  OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.	
	
  OLIVER. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.	
	
  OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me	
	
  OLIVIA, a rich countess	
	
  OLIVIA. Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,	
	
  OLIVIA. Can you do it?	
	
  OLIVIA. Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,	
	
  OLIVIA. Here, wear this jewel for me; 'tis my picture.	
	
  OLIVIA. I do I know not what, and fear to find	
	
  OLIVIA. Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.	
	
  OLIVIA. Run after that same peevish messenger,	
	
  OLIVIA. Sir, I bade them take away you.	
	
  OLIVIA. Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine	
	
  OLIVIA. Who has done this, Sir Andrew?	
	
  OLIVIA. Why, what's the matter? Does he rave?	
	
  ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,	
	
  ORLANDO. Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.	
	
  ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.	
	
  ORLANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.	
	
  ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.	
	
  ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth.	
	
  ORLANDO. Nor I.                                         Exeunt	
	
  ORLANDO. O good old man, how well in thee appears	
	
  ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.	
	
  ORLANDO. What sayest thou?	
	
  ORLANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a	
	
  ORLANDO. With all my heart, good youth.	
	
  ORLEANS. He is simply the most active gentleman of France.	
	
  ORLEANS. Ill-wind never said well.	
	
  ORLEANS. You are as well provided of both as any prince in the	
	
  OTHELLO.                                 With all my heart.	
	
  OTHELLO.                          Let me see your eyes;	
	
  OTHELLO.                       No, his mouth is stopp'd;	
	
  OTHELLO.                      Why, anything;	
	
  OTHELLO.                    Went he hence now?	
	
  OTHELLO.                Dost thou hear, Iago?	
	
  OTHELLO.              Farewell, farewell.	
	
  OTHELLO.             Come, let us to the castle.	
	
  OTHELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;	
	
  OTHELLO. Are not you a strumpet?	
	
  OTHELLO. Ay.	
	
  OTHELLO. Did he confess it?	
	
  OTHELLO. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.	
	
  OTHELLO. Have you scored me? Well.	
	
  OTHELLO. I am to blame.	
	
  OTHELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.	
	
  OTHELLO. I think so too.	
	
  OTHELLO. Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they	
	
  OTHELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.	
	
  OTHELLO. Not?	
	
  OTHELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!	
	
  OTHELLO. She's like a liar gone to burning hell;	
	
  OTHELLO. The handkerchief!	
	
  OTHELLO. The tyrant custom, most grave senators,	
	
  OTHELLO. Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!	
	
  OTHELLO. What then?	
	
  OTHELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless	
	
  OXFORD. Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,	
	
  OXFORD. I thought no less. It is his policy	
	
  OXFORD. Women and children of so high a courage,	
	
  Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,	
	
  Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?	
	
  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.	
	
  Old Man. I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,	
	
  One on another's neck do witness bear	
	
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,	
	
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?	
	
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.	
	
  Oph. No more but so?	
	
  Oph. The King rises.	
	
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,	
	
  Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,	
	
  Or bends with the remover to remove.	
	
  Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,	
	
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,	
	
  Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd,	
	
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-	
	
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?	
	
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.	
	
  Osw. I never gave him any.	
	
  Osw. Madam, here comes my lord.                          Exit.	
	
  Osw. What dost thou know me for?	
	
  Other. Go to!

  PAGE. I am glad to see your worships well. I thank you for

  PAINTER. 'Tis common.	
	
  PAINTER. Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' th' time;	
	
  PAINTER. It wears, sir, as it grows.	
	
  PANDARUS. A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so troubles	
	
  PANDARUS. At whose pleasure, friend?	
	
  PANDARUS. But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and	
	
  PANDARUS. Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.	
	
  PANDARUS. Ha, ha! Alas, poor wretch! a poor capocchia! hast not	
	
  PANDARUS. Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may see	
	
  PANDARUS. I thank you for that; if my lord get a boy of you, you'll	
	
  PANDARUS. Know you the musicians?	
	
  PANDARUS. Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall it not,	
	
  PANDARUS. Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they spend	
	
  PANDARUS. That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a	
	
  PANDARUS. Walk here i' th' orchard, I'll bring her straight.	
	
  PANDARUS. What says my sweet queen?-My cousin will fall out with	
	
  PANDARUS. Where?	
	
  PANDARUS. You are such a woman! A man knows not at what ward you	
	
  PANDARUS. You spy! What do you spy?-Come, give me an instrument.	
	
  PANDULPH. O, Sir, when he shall hear of your approach,	
	
  PANDULPH. So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith;	
	
  PARIS. Else might the world convince of levity	
	
  PARIS. His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek	
	
  PARIS. [Within] Brother Troilus!	
	
  PAROLLES. And debile minister, great power, great transcendence;	
	
  PAROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my boy, to th'	
	
  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?	
	
  PAROLLES. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.	
	
  PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos' regiment,	
	
  PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it	
	
  PAROLLES. It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall

  PAROLLES. O!	
	
  PAROLLES. Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-

  PATROCLUS. I shall say so to him.                              Exit	
	
  PATROCLUS. Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his	
	
  PATROCLUS. Why, thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest thou	
	
  PEDANT. Ay, what else? And, but I be deceived,	
	
  PEDANT. My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.	
	
  PEMBROKE. His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief	
	
  PEMBROKE. There tell the King he may inquire us out.	
	
  PERCY. His answer was, he would unto the stews,	
	
  PETER, his man	
	
  PETER. Now is your time; speak loud, and kneel before him.	
	
  PETO. The King your father is at Westminster;	
	
  PETRUCHIO. A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.	
	
  PETRUCHIO. And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect.	
	
  PETRUCHIO. I hope better.	
	
  PETRUCHIO. I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of this	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Then show it me.	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see't.	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Whose tongue?	
	
  PETRUCHIO. Why, what's a moveable?	
	
  PHEBE, a shepherdes	
	
  PHEBE. I would not be thy executioner;	
	
  PHEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;	
	
  PHILARIO. Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court	
	
  PHILARIO. You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he	
	
  PHILOSTRATE. No, my noble lord,	
	
  PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA. More counsel with more money, bounteous	
	
  PISANIO. Alas, good lady!	
	
  PISANIO. I am most glad	
	
  PISANIO. Madam, here is a letter from my lord.	
	
  PISANIO. O good my lord!	
	
  PISANIO. Please you read,	
	
  PISANIO. [Aside] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,	
	
  PISTOL	
	
  PISTOL. As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.	
	
  PISTOL. Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,	
	
  PISTOL. God bless thy lungs, good knight!	
	
  PISTOL. Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and master	
	
  PISTOL. I'll see her damn'd first; to Pluto's damn'd lake, by this	
	
  PISTOL. Let housewifery appear; keep close, I thee command.	
	
  PISTOL. Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.	
	
  PISTOL. Si fortuna me tormenta, spero me contenta.	
	
  PISTOL. The horn, I say. Farewell.	
	
  PISTOL. Thrust him down stairs! Know we not Galloway nags?	
	
  PISTOL. Why, then the world's mine oyster. Which I with	
	
  PLANTAGENET. And I.	
	
  PLANTAGENET. My father was attached, not attainted;	
	
  PLANTAGENET. Of Which, my lord, your honour is the last.	
	
  PLEBEIANS. It shall be so, it shall be so.	
	
  PLEBEIANS. To th' rock, to th' rock, with him!	
	
  POET. I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him. It	
	
  POET. Sir,	
	
  POET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.	
	
  POINS.  [Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight'- Every man must know that	
	
  POINS. Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have	
	
  POINS. Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.	
	
  POMPEY. By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than	
	
  POMPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,	
	
  POMPEY. I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.	
	
  POMPEY. I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing	
	
  POMPEY. Let's ha't, good soldier.	
	
  POMPEY. Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and	
	
  POMPEY. Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind; but yet	
	
  POMPEY. Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is	
	
  POMPEY. What, I pray you?	
	
  POMPEY. Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so good, sir,	
	
  PORTER. Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and	
	
  PORTER. I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.	
	
  PORTIA.  [Aside]  Too long a pause for that which you find there.	
	
  PORTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,	
	
  PORTIA. Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.

  SIR STEPHEN SCROOP                    SIR PIERCE OF EXTON	
	
  SIR TOBY. A false conclusion! I hate it as an unfill'd can. To be	
	
  SIR TOBY. Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.	
	
  SIR TOBY. Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man, 'tis not for gravity	
	
  SIR TOBY. Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.	
	
  SIR TOBY. Excellent wench, say I.	
	
  SIR TOBY. He is knight, dubb'd with unhatch'd rapier and on carpet	
	
  SIR TOBY. I could marry this wench for this device.	
	
  SIR TOBY. Let him be the devil an he will, I care not; give me	
	
  SIR TOBY. No question.	
	
  SIR TOBY. Out, scab!	
	
  SIR TOBY. Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.	
	
  SIR TOBY. To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall

  SIR TOBY. Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.

  SIR TOBY. [To VIOLA] There's no remedy, sir: he will fight with you	
	
  SIR WILLIAM CATESBY	
	
  SLENDER.  [Aside]  Ah, sweet Anne Page!	
	
  SLENDER. Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her, and we have	
	
  SLENDER. Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in	
	
  SLENDER. I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there	
	
  SLENDER. I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as	
	
  SLENDER. That's meat and drink to me now. I have seen	
	
  SLENDER. Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?	
	
  SLY. Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.	
	
  SLY. Well, we'll see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let	
	
  SMITH. Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and the bricks	
	
  SNOUT. Here, Peter Quince.	
	
  SOLANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,	
	
  SOLANIO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad	
	
  SOLDIER. Mock not, Enobarbus.	
	
  SOLDIERS. It shall be done.	
	
  SOLDIERS. [Speaking together] How now!	
	
  SOMERSET. By Him that made me, I'll maintain my words	
	
  SOMERSET. Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious	
	
  SOMERSET. My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.	
	
  SOMERSET. Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,	
	
  SON. And be all traitors that do so?	
	
  SON. Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester	
	
  SON. Was ever son so rued a father's death?	
	
  SOOTHSAYER. At mine own house, good lady.	
	
  SOOTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but	
	
  SOOTHSAYER. You shall be yet far fairer than you are.	
	
  SPIRIT. Ask what thou wilt; that I had said and done.	
	
  STANLEY, what news with you?	
	
  STANLEY. No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.	
	
  STARVELING. He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.	
	
  STEPHANO. Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is	
	
  STEPHANO. Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!	
	
  STEPHANO. He that dies pays all debts. I defy thee. Mercy	
	
  STEPHANO. Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest	
	
  STEPHANO. Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll	
	
  STEPHANO. There is not only disgrace and dishonour in	
	
  STEWARD, Servant to the Countess of Rousillon	
	
  STRATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.	
	
  SUFFOLK.  [Aside]  It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.	
	
  SUFFOLK. A jewel, lock'd into the woefull'st cask	
	
  SUFFOLK. And here I will expect thy coming.	
	
  SUFFOLK. Before we make election, give me leave	
	
  SUFFOLK. Farewell, sweet madam. But hark you, Margaret	
	
  SUFFOLK. How is the King employ'd?	
	
  SUFFOLK. I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.	
	
  SUFFOLK. Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness then	
	
  SUFFOLK. Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?	
	
  SUFFOLK. Sir, I did never win of you before.	
	
  SUFFOLK. Sweet madam, give me hearing in a cause	
	
  SUFFOLK. Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,	
	
  SUFFOLK. Why, as you, my lord,	
	
  SURREY. But will the King	
	
  SURREY. Item, you sent a large commission	
	
  SURREY. Sir,	
	
  SURVEYOR. He was brought to this	
	
  Sailor. God bless you, sir.	
	
  Samp. Fear me not.	
	
  Sampson, servant to Capulet.	
	
  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,	
	
  Serv. He is, my lord, an hour ago.	
	
  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!	
	
  Sex. Master Constable, you go not the way to examine. You must call	
	
  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?	
	
  Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;	
	
  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;	
	
  Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,	
	
  Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,	
	
  Sir M. But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,	
	
  So I, to find a mother and a brother,	
	
  So fly I from her that would be my wife.	
	
  So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!	
	
  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,	
	
  Soldiers, Attendants, Messengers, Watchmen, etc.	
	
  Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;	
	
  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.	
	
  Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.	
	
  Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?	
	
  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.	
	
  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:	
	
  TALBOT. Bring forth the body of old Salisbury	
	
  TALBOT. Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?	
	
  TALBOT. Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?	
	
  TALBOT. My gracious Prince, and honourable peers,	
	
  TALBOT. Then follow thou thy desp'rate sire of Crete,	
	
  TALBOT. When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck	
	
  TAMORA, Queen of the Goths	
	
  TAMORA. Give me the poniard; you shall know, my boys,	
	
  TAMORA. Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora:	
	
  TAMORA. This closing with him fits his lunacy.	
	
  TAMORA. Where is my lord the King?	
	
  THE DUKE OF FLORENCE	
	
  THERSITES, a deformed and scurrilous Greek	
	
  THERSITES. Do I curse thee?	
	
  THERSITES. Ha!	
	
  THERSITES. I say this Ajax-             [AJAX offers to strike him]	
	
  THERSITES. If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven of the clock it	
	
  THERSITES. Nay, look upon him.	
	
  THERSITES. Peace, fool! I have not done.	
	
  THERSITES. Thou art proclaim'd, a fool, I think.	
	
  THERSITES. Who, I? Why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not	
	
  THESEUS. Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,	
	
  THESEUS. I will hear that play;	
	
  THESEUS. Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.	
	
  THESEUS. Thanks, good Egeus; what's the news with thee?	
	
  THESEUS. True; and a goose for his discretion.	
	
  THIRD CITIZEN. And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very	
	
  THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, still is it so;	
	
  THIRD CITIZEN. O royal Caesar!	
	
  THIRD CITIZEN. When clouds are seen, wise men put on	
	
  THIRD GENTLEMAN. All the land knows that;	
	
  THIRD GENTLEMAN. I know it;	
	
  THIRD LORD. I feel't upon my bones.	
	
  THIRD MESSENGER. O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,	
	
  THIRD MURTHERER. Hark! I hear horses.	
	
  THIRD SERVANT. Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as	
	
  THIRD SERVANT. Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other	
	
  THIRD SERVANT. Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general-	
	
  THIRD SOLDIER. 'Tis a brave army,	
	
  THIRD WATCHMAN. O, is it So? But why commands the King	
	
  THIRD WITCH. That will be ere the set of sun.

  TIMON. A fool of thee. Depart.	
	
  TIMON. As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.	
	
  TIMON. Come, sermon me no further.	
	
  TIMON. Commend me to him; I will send his ransom;	
	
  TIMON. Freely, good father.	
	
  TIMON. Have I once liv'd to see two honest men?	
	
  TIMON. I have so; what of him?	
	
  TIMON. I thank you; you shall hear from me anon;	
	
  TIMON. Imprison'd is he, say you?	
	
  TIMON. Let it not cumber your better remembrance. [The banquet	
	
  TIMON. Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?	
	
  TIMON. O, by no means,

  TIMON. To sauce thy dishes.	
	
  TIMON. Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand;

  TITANIA. My Oberon! What visions have I seen!	
	
  TITANIA. Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.	
	
  TITINIUS. MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.	
	
  TITUS LARTIUS	
	
  TITUS. 'Tis sure enough, an you knew how;	
	
  TITUS. Come hither, Aaron, I'll deceive them both;	
	
  TITUS. Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,	
	
  TITUS. How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?	
	
  TITUS. I give him you- the noblest that survives,	
	
  TITUS. It was my dear, and he that wounded her	
	
  TITUS. Marcus, my brother! 'Tis sad Titus calls.	
	
  TITUS. O, O, O!	
	
  TITUS. Sirrah, come hither. Make no more ado,	
	
  TITUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.	
	
  TITUS. Traitors, away! He rests not in this tomb.	
	
  TITUS. Who doth molest my contemplation?	
	
  TOUCHSTONE.   For a taste:	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.

  TROILUS. Come, kiss; and let us part.	
	
  TROILUS. Cressid comes forth to him.	
	
  TROILUS. Good brother, come you hither;	
	
  TROILUS. He's dead, and at the murderer's horse's tail,	
	
  TROILUS. How now! What's the matter?	
	
  TROILUS. My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,

  TUBAL, a Jew, his friend	
	
  TUBAL. There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to	
	
  TWO VOLSCIAN GUARDS	
	
  TYRREL. The tyrannous and bloody act is done,	
	
  Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;	
	
  Tempteth my better angel from my side,	
	
  Than our earth's wonder-more than earth, divine.	
	
  Than when it hath my added praise beside.	
	
  That Time comes stealing on by night and day?	
	
  That do not do the thing, they most do show,	
	
  That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,	
	
  That his attendant-so his case was like,	
	
  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;	
	
  That may with foul intrusion enter in	
	
  That others touch and, often touching, will	
	
  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows	
	
  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,	
	
  That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;	
	
  That you would put me to this shame and trouble;	
	
  The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,	
	
  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,	
	
  The debt he owes will be requir'd of me.	
	
  The folded meaning of your words' deceit.	
	
  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,	
	
  The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,	
	
  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.	
	
  The second burthen of a former child!	
	
  The very part was consecrate to thee,	
	
  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,	
	
  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)	
	
  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,	
	
  There is a purse of ducats; let her send it.	
	
  There's nothing situate under heaven's eye	
	
  Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,	
	
  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:	
	
  They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.	
	
  Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail	
	
  Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,	
	
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:	
	
  Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress;	
	
  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,	
	
  Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,	
	
  Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;	
	
  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,	
	
  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,	
	
  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;	
	
  Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,	
	
  Till each to razed oblivion yield his part	
	
  To be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.	
	
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,	
	
  To him one of the other twins was bound,	
	
  To know the reason of this strange restraint.	
	
  To make it wander in an unknown field?	
	
  To play the watchman ever for thy sake.	
	
  To put the finger in the eye and weep,	
	
  To side this title is impanelled	
	
  To truths translated, and for true things deemed.	
	
  To work my mind, when body's work's expired.	
	
  Traveller. O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!	
	
  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.	
	
  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.	
	
  ULYSSES. Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.	
	
  ULYSSES. How now, my lord?	
	
  ULYSSES. I'll bring you to the gates.	
	
  ULYSSES. Nor mine, my lord. Cressid was here but now.	
	
  ULYSSES. So to him we leave it.	
	
  ULYSSES. The youngest son of Priam, a true knight;	
	
  ULYSSES. Why then, for Venus' sake give me a kiss	
	
  ULYSSES. You are moved, Prince; let us depart, I pray,	
	
  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,	
	
  Until life's composition be recured,	
	
  Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds	
	
  Urs. She's lim'd, I warrant you! We have caught her, madam.	
	
  Urs. You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very	
	
  VALENTINE. If the Duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario,	
	
  VALERIA. Well then, farewell.                           Exeunt	
	
  VARRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:	
	
  VARRO. CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.             Exeunt.	
	
  VAUGHAN. You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.	
	
  VERNON. And that is my petition, noble lord;	
	
  VERNON. Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,	
	
  VINCENTIO. His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him	
	
  VINCENTIO. Lucentio, gentle sir.	
	
  VIOLA, sister of Sebastian	
	
  VIOLA. And so they are; alas, that they are so!	
	
  VIOLA. By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for one;	
	
  VIOLA. I am all the daughters of my father's house,	
	
  VIOLA. I pray you, sir, what is he?	
	
  VIOLA. I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we are	
	
  VIOLA. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for	
	
  VIOLA. My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant	
	
  VIOLA. Orsino! I have heard my father name him.	
	
  VIOLA. The honourable lady of the house, which is she?	
	
  VIOLA. Then think you right: I am not what I am.	
	
  VIOLA. Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?	
	
  VIRGILIA. Ay, and mine,	
	
  VIRGILIA. I am glad to see your ladyship.	
	
  VIRGILIA. O the gods!	
	
  VOLSCE. You take my part from me, sir. I have the most cause to be	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this, fool:	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Because that now it lies you on to speak	
	
  VOLUMNIA. I prithee now, My son,	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Nay, go not from us thus.	
	
  VOLUMNIA. One on's father's moods.	
	
  VOLUMNIA. True! pow, waw.	
	
  VOLUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.	
	
  Ver. Do not, my lord.	
	
  Verg. By'r lady, I think it be so.	
	
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.	
	
  WART. Yea, sir.	
	
  WARWICK. And I'll keep London with my soldiers.	
	
  WARWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head,	
	
  WARWICK. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.	
	
  WARWICK. Can Oxford that did ever fence the right	
	
  WARWICK. Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.	
	
  WARWICK. How far off is our brother Montague?	
	
  WARWICK. Injurious Margaret!	
	
  WARWICK. It cannot be, my lord.	
	
  WARWICK. Methinks his lordship should be humbler;	
	
  WARWICK. Not so much noise, my lords. Sweet Prince, speak low;	
	
  WARWICK. See how the blood is settled in his face.	
	
  WARWICK. Speak lower, Princes, for the King recovers.	
	
  WARWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.	
	
  WARWICK. Then let the earth be drunken with our blood.	
	
  WARWICK. Unsavoury news! But how made he escape?	
	
  WARWICK. What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,	
	
  WARWICK. Why then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague,	
	
  WARWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;	
	
  WESTMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!	
	
  WESTMORELAND. I pledge your Grace; and if you knew what pains	
	
  WESTMORELAND. That argues but the shame of your offence:	
	
  WESTMORELAND. You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.	
	
  WIDOW. At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.	
	
  WIDOW. I should believe you;	
	
  WIDOW. Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh	
	
  WIDOW. Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,	
	
  WILLIAM STAFFORD. But angry, wrathful, and inclin'd to blood,	
	
  WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.	
	
  WILLIAM. Pulcher.	
	
  WILLIAMS. A good old commander and a most kind gentleman. I pray	
	
  WILLIAMS. Let it be a quarrel between us if you live.	
	
  WILLIAMS. That's more than we know.	
	
  WILLOUGHBY. Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.	
	
  WINCHESTER. Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe	
	
  WINCHESTER. I do, thou most usurping proditor,	
	
  WOLSEY. All goodness	
	
  WOLSEY. Heaven forgive me!	
	
  WOLSEY. Is he ready	
	
  WOLSEY. Madam, this is a mere distraction;	
	
  WOLSEY. Noble lady,	
	
  WOLSEY. Speak on, sir;	
	
  WOLSEY. What should this mean?	
	
  WOLSEY. Whilst our commission from Rome is read,	
	
  WOODVILLE, Lieutenant of the Tower	
	
  Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.	
	
  We came into the world like brother and brother,	
	
  West. I will my liege.                                 Exeunt.	
	
  West. This, match'd with other, did, my gracious lord;	
	
  What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.	
	
  What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?	
	
  When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,	
	
  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,	
	
  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,	
	
  When in the least of them my life hath end,	
	
  When other petty griefs have done their spite,	
	
  When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,	
	
  When you have bid your servant once adieu.	
	
  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:	
	
  Wherein I should your great deserts repay,	
	
  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:	
	
  Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,	
	
  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,	
	
  Which shall above that idle rank remain	
	
  Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd,	
	
  While she with harlots feasted in my house.	
	
  Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,	
	
  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:	
	
  Who moving others, are themselves as stone,	
	
  Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,	
	
  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;	
	
  Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,	
	
  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme	
	
  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?	
	
  With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,	
	
  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?	
	
  With my extern the outward honouring,	
	
  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,	
	
  Wor. And so they shall.	
	
  Wor. Good cousin, be advis'd; stir not to-night.	
	
  Wor. Peace, cousin, say no more;	
	
  Wor. Yea, but a little charge will trench him here	
	
  Would that alone a love he would detain,	
	
  YORK. Alencon, that notorious Machiavel!	
	
  YORK. And so he did; but yet I like it not,	
	
  YORK. Bring forth that sorceress, condemn'd to burn.	
	
  YORK. Damsel of France, I think I have you fast.	
	
  YORK. Grandam, his nurse.
