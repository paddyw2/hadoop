     False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;	
	
     For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-

    An eye-sore to our solemn festival!	
	
    An hour of revels with 'em.	
	
    An if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,	
	
    An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds	
	
    An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,	
	
    An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,	
	
    And 'tis no marvel, be is so humorous.	
	
    And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.	
	
    And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony	
	
    And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for	
	
    And Florence is denied before he comes;	
	
    And God befriend us as our cause is just!	
	
    And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,	
	
    And I am I, howe'er I was begot.	
	
    And I am tied to be obedient-	
	
    And I confess, besides, I am no maid.	
	
    And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.	
	
    And I do haunt thee in the battle thus	
	
    And I have better news in store for you	
	
    And I in better state than e'er I was.	
	
    And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.	
	
    And I repent my fault more than my death;	
	
    And I the rather wean me from despair	
	
    And I will fill them with prophetic tears.	
	
    And I will kiss thy detestable bones,	
	
    And I will purge thy mortal grossness so	
	
    And I will take it as a sweet disgrace	
	
    And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;	
	
    And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,	
	
    And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,	
	
    And I- like one lost in a thorny wood	
	
    And Montague our top-mast; what of him?	
	
    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee	
	
    And Sir John Stanley is appointed now	
	
    And William de la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk.	
	
    And a clear life ensuing.	
	
    And add more coals to Cancer when he burns	
	
    And after, every of this happy number,	
	
    And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.	
	
    And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,	
	
    And all my study be to no effect?	
	
    And all that we upon this side the sea-	
	
    And all the fellowship I hold now with him	
	
    And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.	
	
    And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail	
	
    And all their ministers attend on him.	
	
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.	
	
    And all we mourn for.	
	
    And am right glad he is not standing here	
	
    And an adopted name of privilege-	
	
    And are upon the Mediterranean flote	
	
    And as a suitor will I give him this.	
	
    And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,	
	
    And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,	
	
    And as the wretch whose fever-weak'ned joints,	
	
    And at that time bequeath you my diseases.                   Exit	
	
    And at the port expect you.	
	
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like	
	
    And be a carrion monster like thyself.	
	
    And be it death proclaimed through our host	
	
    And be not easily won to our requests.	
	
    And be thy wife, if any be so mad,	
	
    And bear possession of our person here,	
	
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;	
	
    And being not done, where doing tends to ill,	
	
    And better in my mind not undertook.	
	
    And bid him come to take his last farewell.	
	
    And bid me say to you by word of mouth-	
	
    And bid the main flood bate his usual height;	
	
    And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.	
	
    And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.	
	
    And blessed shall he be that doth revolt	
	
    And boding screech-owls make the consort full!	
	
    And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'	
	
    And bow this feeble ruin to the earth;	
	
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe	
	
    And bring our Emperor gently in thy hand,	
	
    And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate	
	
    And brings the dire occasion in his arms	
	
    And brought us thus together?	
	
    And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,	
	
    And but she spoke it dying, I would not	
	
    And by a gem of women, to be abus'd	
	
    And by his hollow whistling in the leaves	
	
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-	
	
    And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.	
	
    And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now?	
	
    And call him noble that was now your hate,	
	
    And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus;	
	
    And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.	
	
    And cannot live but to thy shame, unless	
	
    And celebrate our drink?	
	
    And change you favours too; so shall your loves	
	
    And chastise with the valor of my tongue	
	
    And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,	
	
    And come to Padua, careless of your life!	
	
    And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much;	
	
    And consciences that will not die in debt	
	
    And cordial to me, have I not found it	
	
    And cried 'All hail!' when as he meant all harm.	
	
    And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.	
	
    And curb this cruel devil of his will.	
	
    And dallies with the innocence of love,	
	
    And dangers are to me indifferent.	
	
    And dash themselves to pieces.	
	
    And deck my body in gay ornaments,	
	
    And didst contract and purse thy brow together,	
	
    And die in bands for this unmanly deed!	
	
    And dispossess her all.	
	
    And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.	
	
    And do you now strew flowers in his way	
	
    And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,	
	
    And drave great Mars to faction.	
	
    And drink carouses to the next day's fate,	
	
    And dull, unfeeling, barren ignorance	
	
    And duty in his service perishing.	
	
    And either end in peace- which God so frame!-	
	
    And entertain'd me with mine own device;	
	
    And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs	
	
    And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd,	
	
    And every day do honour to her grave.	
	
    And every lovely organ of her life	
	
    And evils imminent, and on her knee	
	
    And fall on my side so, against your will.	
	
    And fall to reprobation.	
	
    And fawn on rage with base humility,	
	
    And feed his humour kindly as we may	
	
    And fighting foot to foot.	
	
    And find me worse provided.	
	
    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!	
	
    And fitter is my study and my books	
	
    And flies fled under shade-why, then the thing of courage	
	
    And follow me with speed. I'll to the King;	
	
    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat	
	
    And for Mark Antony, think not of him,	
	
    And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.	
	
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,	
	
    And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.	
	
    And for thy treachery, what's more manifest	
	
    And for your rapier most especially,	
	
    And found it was his brother, his elder brother.	
	
    And frame my face to all occasions.	
	
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh	
	
    And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder,	
	
    And from the powd'ring tub of infamy	
	
    And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.	
	
    And gave the tongue a helpful ornament-	
	
    And girt thee with the sword. Cousin of York,	
	
    And give direction. And do but see his vice;	
	
    And give him light that it was blinded by.	
	
    And give sweet passage to my sinful soul.	
	
    And given me justice, justice, justice, justice.	
	
    And given way unto this course of fortune,	
	
    And go with you.                                            Exit.	
	
    And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;	
	
    And graze in commons.	
	
    And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;	
	
    And had I first been put to speak my mind,	
	
    And half their faces buried in their cloaks,	
	
    And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her;	
	
    And happiness to his accomplices!	
	
    And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.	
	
    And have a thousand times more cause than he	
	
    And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer	
	
    And have their provender tied to their mouths,	
	
    And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,	
	
    And he himself confess'd but even now	
	
    And he repents not that he pays your debt;	
	
    And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,	
	
    And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,	
	
    And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,	
	
    And he whose wife is most obedient,	
	
    And health on both!	
	
    And heaven defend your good souls, that you think	
	
    And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up	
	
    And henceforth I am thy true servitor.	
	
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge	
	
    And here another. The one of them imports	
	
    And here in sight of Rome, to Saturnine,	
	
    And here's a lord-come knights from east to west	
	
    And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,	
	
    And high and low beguiles the rich and poor;	
	
    And his affections dark as Erebus.	
	
    And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.	
	
    And his physicians fear him mightily.	
	
    And hither make, as great ambassadors	
	
    And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia,	
	
    And honourable carriage,	
	
    And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times?	
	
    And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,	
	
    And if he were, he came into the world	
	
    And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,	
	
    And if their wisdoms be misled in this,	
	
    And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,	
	
    And if you can be merry then, I'll say	
	
    And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind;	
	
    And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart	
	
    And in my conscience do repute his Grace	
	
    And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd,	
	
    And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;	
	
    And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,	
	
    And in the cup an union shall he throw	
	
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth	
	
    And in the taste confounds the appetite.	
	
    And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal'd bit	
	
    And in this resolution here we leave you.	
	
    And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.	
	
    And interchangeably hurl down my gage	
	
    And is not this an honourable spoil?	
	
    And it must follow, as the night the day,	
	
    And just against thy heart make thou a hole,	
	
    And keep me on the side where still I am.	
	
    And keep the gate of hell!	
	
    And kept his credit with his purse;	
	
    And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack	
	
    And know how well I have deserv'd this ring,	
	
    And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.	
	
    And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.	
	
    And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;	
	
    And lay them gently on thy tender side.	
	
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,	
	
    And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.	
	
    And leave those woes alone which I alone	
	
    And left me to a bootless inquisition,	
	
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see	
	
    And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,	
	
    And let it answer every strain for strain,	
	
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world	
	
    And let mischance be slave to patience.	
	
    And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,	
	
    And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas	
	
    And let them work. The nature of our people,	
	
    And let us once again assail your ears,	
	
    And let young Arthur, Duke of Britaine, in,	
	
    And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.	
	
    And like a mountain not to be remov'd.	
	
    And like rich hangings in a homely house,	
	
    And live a coward in thine own esteem,	
	
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,	
	
    And look how well my garments sit upon me,	
	
    And lose advantage, which doth ever cool	
	
    And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath	
	
    And made defeat of her virginity--	
	
    And made me climb, With danger of my life.	
	
    And majesty might never yet endure	
	
    And make a monster of you.	
	
    And make assurance here in Padua	
	
    And make him proud to make me proud that jests!	
	
    And make my image but an alehouse sign.	
	
    And make the cowards stand aloof at bay.	
	
    And make them dread it, to the doer's thrift.	
	
    And make us even with you. My Thanes and kinsmen,	
	
    And make your bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?	
	
    And makes him roar these accusations forth.	
	
    And many an old man's sigh, and many a widow's,	
	
    And many unfrequented plots there are	
	
    And mark the musical confusion	
	
    And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?	
	
    And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.	
	
    And men may talk of kings, and why not I?	
	
    And might by no suit gain our audience:	
	
    And minister in their steads. To general filths	
	
    And mock your workings in a second body.	
	
    And more thirsts after.	
	
    And most assured that he is a friend,	
	
    And must be buried but as an intent	
	
    And my appointments have in them a need	
	
    And my kind kinsman- warriors all, adieu!	
	
    And ne'er a true one.	
	
    And needs no other suitor but his likings	
	
    And never borrow any tear of thee.	
	
    And never mayst thou come Lysander near!	
	
    And never stir assailants.	
	
    And never yet could frame my will to it;	
	
    And no way canst thou turn thee for redress	
	
    And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead	
	
    And not a hair upon a soldier's head	
	
    And not be Richard that hath done all this.	
	
    And not be check'd.	
	
    And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on;	
	
    And not my husband's secrets?	
	
    And not these bastard Britaines, whom our fathers	
	
    And not where I had aim'd them.	
	
    And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-	
	
    And now I do bethink me, it was she	
	
    And now be it known to you my full intent:	
	
    And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,	
	
    And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,	
	
    And now their pride and mettle is asleep,	
	
    And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,	
	
    And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds	
	
    And observation strange, my meaner ministers	
	
    And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.	
	
    And often at his very loose decides	
	
    And on his son, young John, who two hours since	
	
    And on that day at noon whereon he says	
	
    And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.	
	
    And once again proclaim us King of England.	
	
    And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.	
	
    And our King Henry gives away his own	
	
    And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.	
	
    And out of you she sees herself more proper	
	
    And pale destruction meets thee in the face.	
	
    And part your mingled colours once again,	
	
    And patient underbearing of his fortune,	
	
    And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till	
	
    And pity to the general wrong of Rome-	
	
    And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?	
	
    And point by point the treasons of his master	
	
    And pour'd them down before him.	
	
    And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with	
	
    And preachers to us all, admonishing	
	
    And princess no worse issued.	
	
    And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,	
	
    And prove the period of their tyranny,	
	
    And pursy insolence shall break his wind	
	
    And quaff carouses to our mistress' health;	
	
    And quickly will return an injury;	
	
    And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,	
	
    And rather comfort his distressed plight	
	
    And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother	
	
    And recks not his own rede.	
	
    And rest your gentle head upon her lap,	
	
    And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy	
	
    And sack great Rome with Romans.	
	
    And saving those that eye thee!	
	
    And say 'These wounds I had on Crispian's day.'	
	
    And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian.'	
	
    And say withal I think he held the right.	
	
    And says a wizard told him that by G	
	
    And see another, as I see thee now,	
	
    And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady;	
	
    And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead,	
	
    And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass	
	
    And sell the mighty space of our large honors	
	
    And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.	
	
    And set a double varnish on the fame	
	
    And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,	
	
    And set upon our boasting enemy.	
	
    And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.	
	
    And shall the figure of God's majesty,	
	
    And she died singing it. That song tonight	
	
    And she is mine; and all my right of her	
	
    And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,	
	
    And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.	
	
    And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.	
	
    And show what we alone must think, which never	
	
    And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure	
	
    And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.	
	
    And since you could not be my son-in-law,	
	
    And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;	
	
    And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;	
	
    And smell of calumny. I have begun,	
	
    And so I am awake. Poor wretches, that depend	
	
    And so adieu, sweet Jude! Nay, why dost thou stay?	
	
    And so am I for Phebe.	
	
    And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart	
	
    And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,	
	
    And so let me entreat you leave the house.	
	
    And so rebel to judgment.	
	
    And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go.	
	
    And so should you.	
	
    And so your follies fight against yourself.	
	
    And so, farewell; and fair be all thy hopes,	
	
    And soar with them above a common bound.	
	
    And something over to remember me by.	
	
    And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,	
	
    And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,	
	
    And spend her strength with over-matching waves.	
	
    And spotless shall mine innocence arise,	
	
    And stablish quietness on every side.	
	
    And stand unshaken yours.	
	
    And started when he look'd upon the Tower,	
	
    And still as you are weary of this weight	
	
    And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.	
	
    And strain what other means is left unto us	
	
    And strong enough to issue out and fight.	
	
    And such a welcome as I'd give to him	
	
    And suffer the condition of these times	
	
    And suffer'd my command.	
	
    And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.                Exit	
	
    And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!	
	
    And take him from our presence.	
	
    And take upon command what help we have	
	
    And takes away the stomach- such are the rich	
	
    And tapers burn so bright, and everything	
	
    And tell him who hath sent me after him.	
	
    And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?	
	
    And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,	
	
    And tempt us not to bear above our power!	
	
    And thankfully rest debtor for the first.	
	
    And that I partly know the instrument	
	
    And that be heir to his unhappiness!	
	
    And that hereafter ages may behold	
	
    And that my fortune runs against the bias.	
	
    And that my sword upon thee shall approve,	
	
    And that small model of the barren earth	
	
    And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.	
	
    And that we are contented Caesar shall	
	
    And that which should accompany old age,	
	
    And that you will some good instruction give	
	
    And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.	
	
    And the beholders of this frantic play,	
	
    And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.	
	
    And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,	
	
    And the moon changes even as your mind.	
	
    And the premised flames of the last day	
	
    And the rank poison of the old will die.	
	
    And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls;	
	
    And then I need not crave his courtesy.	
	
    And then again begin, and stop again,	
	
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,	
	
    And then end life when I end loyalty!	
	
    And then she's yours.	
	
    And then the King will court thee for his dear;	
	
    And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life	
	
    And then your Highness shall command a peace.	
	
    And thence discover how with most advantage	
	
    And there cut off thy most ungracious head,	
	
    And there is in this business more than nature	
	
    And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls	
	
    And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'	
	
    And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.	
	
    And therefore is Love said to be a child,	
	
    And therefore little shall I grace my cause	
	
    And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.	
	
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg	
	
    And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,	
	
    And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn	
	
    And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,	
	
    And they have nurs'd this woe in feeding life;	
	
    And they it were that ravished our sister.	
	
    And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,	
	
    And think it but a minute spent in sport.	
	
    And this deceit loses the name of craft,	
	
    And this her easy-held imprisonment	
	
    And this is he was his adopted heir.	
	
    And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,	
	
    And this, so sole and so unmatchable,	
	
    And those his golden beams to you here lent	
	
    And thou and I sit round about some fountain,	
	
    And thou redeem'st thyself. But all, save thee,	
	
    And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,	
	
    And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.        Exeunt	
	
    And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,	
	
    And though he came our enemy, remember	
	
    And though you took his life, as being our foe,	
	
    And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!	
	
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,	
	
    And thus I set my foot on's neck'; even then	
	
    And thus my battle shall be ordered:	
	
    And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending	
	
    And till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman.	
	
    And time, that takes survey of all the world,	
	
    And to her white hand see thou do commend	
	
    And to my fortunes and the people's favour	
	
    And to say so no more.	
	
    And to that woman, when she has done most,	
	
    And to the love and favour of my country	
	
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge	
	
    And touch'd with choler, hot as gunpowder,	
	
    And towards London do they bend their power,	
	
    And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape;	
	
    And try if they can gain your liberty.	
	
    And turn'd into the extremity of love.	
	
    And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,	
	
    And twit with cowardice a man half dead?	
	
    And undertake the teaching of the maid-	
	
    And vanish'd from our sight.	
	
    And venture madly on a desperate mart.	
	
    And vows to crown himself in Westminster.	
	
    And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,	
	
    And watch our vantage in this business;	
	
    And we are barren and bereft of friends,	
	
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain	
	
    And we must root him out. From your affairs	
	
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul	
	
    And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.	
	
    And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,	
	
    And welcome, Somerset. I hold it cowardice	
	
    And well am like to do, for I perceive	
	
    And wet his grave with my repentant tears-	
	
    And what a pitch she flew above the rest!	
	
    And what is left, to lose it by his country	
	
    And what remains will hardly stop the mouth	
	
    And what thou think'st his very action speaks	
	
    And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,	
	
    And when I spy advantage, claim the crown,	
	
    And when I told thee he was of my counsel	
	
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,	
	
    And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,	
	
    And when the mind is quick'ned, out of doubt	
	
    And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,	
	
    And when we are put off, fall to their throats.	
	
    And where my liege's? All about the breast.	
	
    And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,	
	
    And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,	
	
    And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!	
	
    And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?	
	
    And will as tenderly be led by the nose	
	
    And will at last break out into a flame;	
	
    And will not you maintain the thing you teach,	
	
    And will to-morrow with his trumpet call	
	
    And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,	
	
    And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age	
	
    And wit depends on dilatory time.	
	
    And with a care exempt themselves from fear:	
	
    And with an accent tun'd in self-same key	
	
    And with her personage, her tall personage,	
	
    And with his charity slain.	
	
    And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,	
	
    And with some sweet oblivious antidote	
	
    And with the clamour keep her still awake.	
	
    And with the southern clouds contend in tears-	
	
    And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club	
	
    And with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd	
	
    And won by rareness such solemnity.	
	
    And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,	
	
    And would be glad he met with some mischance,	
	
    And would not dash me with their ragged sides,	
	
    And wrangle with my reason, that persuades me	
	
    And writ as little beard.	
	
    And yet I know not how to get the crown,	
	
    And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,	
	
    And yet a place of high respect with me,	
	
    And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.	
	
    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,	
	
    And yet not so-for what can we bequeath	
	
    And yet we have but trivial argument,	
	
    And yet your beards forbid me to interpret	
	
    And yet, in faith, thou bearest thee like a king.	
	
    And yet, to satisfy this good old man,	
	
    And you but waste your words.	
	
    And you may then revolve what tales I have told you	
	
    And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,	
	
    And you the blacker devil!	
	
    And you within it. If he fail of that,	
	
    And you, good brethren, I am much beholding;	
	
    And your great love to me restrains you thus.	
	
    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.	
	
    And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see	
	
    And, after some dispatch in hand at court,	
	
    And, as I think, they have already order	
	
    And, as the jest did glance away from me,	
	
    And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.	
	
    And, bending forward, struck his armed heels	
	
    And, by the near guess of my memory,	
	
    And, countrymen, my loving followers,	
	
    And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself	
	
    And, for the time shall not seem tedious,	
	
    And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:	
	
    And, if thou canst for blushing, view this face,	
	
    And, if you will, tell what hath happened-	
	
    And, in his full and ripened years, himself,	
	
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone	
	
    And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.	
	
    And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,	
	
    And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course,	
	
    And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,	
	
    And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady	
	
    And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.	
	
    And, through the cranks and offices of man,	
	
    And, to begin, wench- so God help me, law!-	
	
    And, when I had it, drew myself apart	
	
    And, where that you you have vow'd to study, lords,	
	
    And, with a feeble grip, says 'Dear my lord,	
	
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,	
	
    Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!	
	
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;	
	
    Another fall of man. Their faults are open.	
	
    Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;	
	
    Answer mere nature- bid them flatter thee.	
	
    Antonio, gratify this gentleman,	
	
    Any beginning to this peevish odds;	
	
    Appals our numbers. Haste we, Diomed,	
	
    Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows	
	
    Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,	
	
    Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,	
	
    Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,	
	
    Are brought to the correction of your law.	
	
    Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains;	
	
    Are fifty thousand strong.	
	
    Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!	
	
    Are landed on your coast, with a supply	
	
    Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.	
	
    Are ministers of Fate; the elements	
	
    Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey,	
	
    Are now become enamour'd on his grave.	
	
    Are pleas'd to breed out your inheritors.	
	
    Are shuffl'd off with such uncurrent pay;	
	
    Are strewings fit'st for graves. Upon their faces.	
	
    Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought;	
	
    Are to your throne and state, children and servants,	
	
    Are we not brothers?	
	
    Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?	
	
    Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.'	
	
    Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet.	
	
    Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.	
	
    Array'd in flames, like to the prince of fiends,	
	
    Art thou damn'd, Hubert.	
	
    Art thou to break into this woman's mood,	
	
    Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,	
	
    As 'tis reported, so.	
	
    As 'twere to banish their affects with him.	
	
    As I am a true spirit, welcome!           [A noise of horns]	
	
    As I before rememb'red, all our state;	
	
    As I can bid thee speak.	
	
    As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,	
	
    As I had title in thy noble husband!	
	
    As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!	
	
    As I intended, for it wrought on her	
	
    As I requir'd; and wot you what I found	
	
    As I would serve a rat.'	
	
    As Priam was for all his valiant sons.	
	
    As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.	
	
    As all impediments in fancy's course	
	
    As answering to the weight. Would I might never	
	
    As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.	
	
    As bending angels; that's their fame in peace.	
	
    As bid me tell my tale in express words,	
	
    As by his smoothed brows it doth appear;	
	
    As by your Grace shall be propounded him	
	
    As confident as is the falcon's flight	
	
    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven	
	
    As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.	
	
    As doth that orbed continent the fire	
	
    As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air	
	
    As ere thy father Henry made it mine;	
	
    As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!	
	
    As fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!	
	
    As fits a king's remembrance.	
	
    As for the brat of this accursed duke,	
	
    As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.	
	
    As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites	
	
    As gifts to Desdemona;	
	
    As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?	
	
    As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.	
	
    As he is fam'd for mildness, peace, and prayer.	
	
    As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;	
	
    As heart can think or courage execute.	
	
    As high in the air as this unthankful king,	
	
    As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,	
	
    As humorous as winter, and as sudden	
	
    As if a man were author of himself	
	
    As if he had been loosed out of hell	
	
    As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast,	
	
    As if the golden fee for which I plead	
	
    As if those organs had deceptious functions	
	
    As in a soul rememb'ring my good friends;	
	
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,	
	
    As iron to adamant, as earth to th' centre-	
	
    As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it	
	
    As it is common for the younger sort	
	
    As it is spoke, she never will admit me.	
	
    As jewels purchas'd at an easy price;	
	
    As like enough it will- I'ld have it copied.	
	
    As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.	
	
    As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall	
	
    As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.	
	
    As may beseem a monarch like himself.	
	
    As mercy does.	
	
    As much as ever Coriolanus did.	
	
    As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.	
	
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,	
	
    As notes whose faculties inclusive were	
	
    As now our flesh is banish'd from this land-	
	
    As once Europa did at lusty Jove	
	
    As our conditions shall consist upon,	
	
    As patches set upon a little breach	
	
    As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,	
	
    As rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow	
	
    As rushing out of doors, to be resolved	
	
    As shall with either part's agreement stand?	
	
    As shore of rock. Attend: this holy fox,	
	
    As smiles upon the forehead of this action	
	
    As that is desperate which we would prevent.	
	
    As that same ague which hath made you lean.	
	
    As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.	
	
    As there is no firm reason to be rend'red	
	
    As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,	
	
    As they themselves would owe them.	
	
    As this their jangling I esteem a sport.	
	
    As those that I am come to tell you of!	
	
    As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!	
	
    As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,	
	
    As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.	
	
    As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?	
	
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.	
	
    As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop.	
	
    As too triumphing, how mine enemies	
	
    As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.	
	
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,	
	
    As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem	
	
    As well I tender you and all of yours!	
	
    As well as speak- it tauntingly replied	
	
    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,	
	
    As when his virtues shining upon others	
	
    As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,	
	
    As willingly as one would kill a fly;	
	
    As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more	
	
    As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.	
	
    As you did mean indeed to be our brother;	
	
    As you on him, Demetrius dote on you.                   Exit	
	
    As you were lesson'd- when he had no power	
	
    As, I confess, it is my nature's plague	
	
    As, force perforce, the age will pour it in-	
	
    As, like to pitch, defile nobility,	
	
    Ask him upon his oath if he does think	
	
    Assure yourselves, will never be unkind.	
	
    At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,	
	
    At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours	
	
    At an unusual hour?	
	
    At blow and thrust, even as again they were	
	
    At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,	
	
    At length broke under me, and now has left me,	
	
    At many leisures I propos'd.	
	
    At requiring,	
	
    At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?	
	
    At this encounter do so much admire	
	
    At whose request the King hath pardon'd them,	
	
    At your industrious scenes and acts of death.	
	
    Attend his Majesty!	
	
    Attend your office and your quality.	
	
    Audacious cruelty. If that the King	
	
    Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal.	
	
    Awake, awake, English nobility!	
	
    Awakes my conscience to confess all this.	
	
    Away with him to death! [To LUCIO] Now, sir, to you.	
	
    Away, I say; commend me to thy master.           Exit TAILOR	
	
    Away, and glister like the god of war	
	
    Away, my Thetis!	
	
    Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed,	
	
    Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such	
	
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat	
	
    Back to our brother of England.	
	
    Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,	
	
    Banish your dotage! Banish usury	
	
    Bardolph and Nym had ten times more valour than this roaring	
	
    Barnardine!	
	
    Bashful sincerity and comely love.	
	
    Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,	
	
    Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,	
	
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.	
	
    Be call'd our mother, but our grave. Where nothing,	
	
    Be crown'd with plagues, that thee alone obey!	
	
    Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.	
	
    Be full expir'd. Thanks, uncle Winchester,	
	
    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water;	
	
    Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about	
	
    Be known unto us. Are you all agreed, lords?	
	
    Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates	
	
    Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;	
	
    Be not disturb'd with my infirmity.	
	
    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,	
	
    Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight;	
	
    Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;	
	
    Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks	
	
    Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin,	
	
    Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.	
	
    Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?	
	
    Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?	
	
    Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at,	
	
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,	
	
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.	
	
    Be you then as the people's officer.	
	
    Bear it coldly but till midnight, and let the issue show itself.	
	
    Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood	
	
    Bearing the King in my behalf along;	
	
    Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.	
	
    Beatrice, get you to heaven. Here's no place for you maids.' So	
	
    Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,	
	
    Because I wish'd this world's eternity.	
	
    Because his painted skin contents the eye?	
	
    Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd.	
	
    Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste.	
	
    Because that she as her attendant hath	
	
    Because we see it; but what we do not see

    Become the forest better than the town?	
	
    Becomes not Titus' brother. Get thee gone;	
	
    Been justled from your senses, know for certain	
	
    Before I be convict by course of law,	
	
    Before I would have granted to that act.	
	
    Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.	
	
    Before him through the city. He forbids it,	
	
    Before sunrising, lest his son George fall	
	
    Before the kings and queens of France.	
	
    Before this earthy prison of their bones,	
	
    Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,	
	
    Before you open it.	
	
    Before, I lov'd thee as a brother, John;	
	
    Beget your happiness, be happy then,	
	
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;	
	
    Begun through malice of the Bishop's men.	
	
    Behold her topp'd?	
	
    Behold this maid. All corners else o' th' earth	
	
    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,	
	
    Being but fourth of that heroic line.	
	
    Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more	
	
    Being full of supper and distempering draughts,	
	
    Being no further enemy to you	
	
    Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing	
	
    Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,	
	
    Being with his presence glutted, gorg'd, and full.

    Between the child and parent.                       [Kneels]	
	
    Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.	
	
    Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;

    Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,	
	
    Both suffer under this complaint we bring,	
	
    Both you of my inclining and the rest.

    Brought my too diligent ear; for several virtues	
	
    Brutus had rather be a villager	
	
    Brutus! Coriolanus! Citizens!	
	
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!	
	
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,	
	
    But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.	
	
    But Barnardine must die this afternoon;	
	
    But God in mercy so deal with my soul	
	
    But I am shepherd to another man,	
	
    But I did find him still mine enemy.	
	
    But I had rather fast from all four days	
	
    But I must make fair weather yet awhile,	
	
    But I will beard him.	
	
    But I will find him when he lies asleep,	
	
    But I will wed thee in another key,	
	
    But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,	
	
    But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?	
	
    But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere.	
	
    But all are banish'd till their conversations	
	
    But always resolute in most extremes.	
	
    But as I travell'd hither through the land,	
	
    But be he as he will, yet once ere night	
	
    But be thou mild, and blush not at my shame,	
	
    But bloody with the enemies of his kin.	
	
    But by example- O, a sin in war	
	
    But by immortal Providence she's mine.	
	
    But can do more in England than the King.	
	
    But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.	
	
    But come!	
	
    But darkness and the gloomy shade of death	
	
    But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms	
	
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,	
	
    But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd	
	
    But even with law against the wilful sons	
	
    But fare you well; perforce I must confess	
	
    But fetter you till death.	
	
    But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here!	
	
    But floods of tears will drown my oratory	
	
    But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,	
	
    But for the handkerchief-	
	
    But for your son- believe it, O, believe it!-	
	
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.	
	
    But go at once.	
	
    But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these	
	
    But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;	
	
    But he's a learned man. May he continue	
	
    But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.	
	
    But herein mean I to enrich my pain,	
	
    But his performance, as he is now, nothing.	
	
    But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,	
	
    But if an humble prayer may prevail,	
	
    But if they will not, throw away that spirit,	
	
    But if without him we be thought too feeble,	
	
    But if your title to the crown be weak,	
	
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;	
	
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,	
	
    But in the less foul profanation.	
	
    But is four Volsces? None of you but is	
	
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice	
	
    But kill not all together.	
	
    But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,	
	
    But let concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,	
	
    But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.	
	
    But let my favours hide thy mangled face;	
	
    But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide	
	
    But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet Duke:	
	
    But little vantage shall I reap thereby,	
	
    But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,	
	
    But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious	
	
    But mine is all as hungry as the sea,	
	
    But miserable most, to love unlov'd?	
	
    But more than these, in love I do deserve.	
	
    But my true love is grown to such excess	
	
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye	
	
    But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?	
	
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;	
	
    But now 'tis made an H.	
	
    But now is Cade driven back, his men dispers'd,	
	
    But now thy uncle is removing hence,	
	
    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?	
	
    But on thy side I may not be too forward,	
	
    But only hope:	
	
    But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.	
	
    But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly	
	
    But poverty could never draw 'em from me-	
	
    But reverence to your calling makes me modest.	
	
    But sadly tell me who.	
	
    But see! while idly I stood looking on,	
	
    But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.	
	
    But since he died and poets better prove,	
	
    But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,	
	
    But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.	
	
    But soft, but see, or rather do not see,	
	
    But still where danger was, still there I met him;	
	
    But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;	
	
    But such as I, without your special pardon,	
	
    But tell the traitor in the highest degree	
	
    But that Achilles, were his brain as barren	
	
    But that I seek occasion how to rise,	
	
    But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,	
	
    But that myself should be the root and father	
	
    But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,	
	
    But that thy face is visard-like, unchanging,	
	
    But that's no matter; let him kill one first.	
	
    But that, till further trial in those charges	
	
    But the protractive trials of great Jove	
	
    But there is come a messenger before,	
	
    But there's but one in all doth hold his place.	
	
    But they will pluck away his natural cause	
	
    But thieves do lose it. Steal not less for this	
	
    But this is worshipful society,	
	
    But thou anon shalt hear of me again;	
	
    But thou dost in thy passages of life	
	
    But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit	
	
    But three days longer, on the pain of death.	
	
    But to defend his person from night-foes?	
	
    But to my mind, though I am native here	
	
    But to support him after. Fare you well.	
	
    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true	
	
    But we in it shall be remembered-	
	
    But we will presently provide for them.	
	
    But welcome as you are. What shall we do?	
	
    But what is like me formerly.	
	
    But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;	
	
    But what was true, and very full of proof.	
	
    But when I tell him he hates flatterers,	
	
    But when it first did help to wound itself.	
	
    But when we in our viciousness grow hard-	
	
    But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?	
	
    But where, to say the truth, I do not know.	
	
    But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?	
	
    But who is man that is not angry?	
	
    But will you hear? The King is my love sworn.	
	
    But with an angry waiter of your hand	
	
    But with proviso and exception,	
	
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.	
	
    But yet I'll make assurance double sure,	
	
    But yet methinks my father's execution	
	
    But yet so just that he will not revenge.	
	
    But you must join in souls to mock me too?	
	
    But you, my honourable lords, may name the time;	
	
    But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house,	
	
    But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.	
	
    But, as in health, come to my natural taste,	
	
    But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;	
	
    But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.	
	
    But, if I help, what do you promise me?	
	
    But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal	
	
    But, my Lord Cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,	
	
    But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,	
	
    But, peace! For from broad words, and 'cause he fail'd	
	
    But, sirrah, there's no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in	
	
    But, taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,	
	
    But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused	
	
    By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,	
	
    By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!	
	
    By a beloved prince, there doth appear	
	
    By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie	
	
    By all the vows that ever men have broke,	
	
    By any token of presumptuous suit,	
	
    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!	
	
    By day's approach look to be visited.	
	
    By doing damned hate upon thyself?	
	
    By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,	
	
    By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,	
	
    By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours.	
	
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age	
	
    By him for whom these shames ye underwent?	
	
    By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath	
	
    By inches waste you. In which time she purpos'd,	
	
    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.	
	
    By many an ounce- he dropt it for his country;	
	
    By me they nothing gain an if I stay:	
	
    By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,	
	
    By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;	
	
    By praising him here who doth hence remain.	
	
    By reason of his adversary's odds:	
	
    By slaves that take their humours for a warrant	
	
    By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;	
	
    By strangling thee in her accursed womb,	
	
    By th' mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:	
	
    By that and all the rites of knighthood else	
	
    By that you love the dearest in this world,	
	
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?	
	
    By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet	
	
    By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?	
	
    By this brave duke came early to his grave;	
	
    By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,	
	
    By throwing it on any other object	
	
    By treason, falsehood, and by treachery,	
	
    By what we can, which can no more but fly.	
	
    By which the world's best garden he achieved,	
	
    By you invited, do attend your presence.	
	
    By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.

    Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS	
	
    Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,	
	
    Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,	
	
    Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,	
	
    Environ you, till mischief and despair	
	
    Equality of two domestic powers	
	
    Ere a determinate resolution, he-	
	
    Ere it was ask'd-but when the way was made,	
	
    Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,	
	
    Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,	
	
    Ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongue.	
	
    Erroneous, mutinous, and unnatural,	
	
    Eternity was in our lips and eyes,	
	
    Even as our days do grow!	
	
    Even at the crying of your nation's crow,	
	
    Even for that our love of old, I prithee,	
	
    Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy,	
	
    Even in the force and road of casualty.	
	
    Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.	
	
    Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.	
	
    Even now the frozen bosom of the North	
	
    Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome.	
	
    Even that your pity is enough to cure me.	
	
    Even this repays me.	
	
    Even to affright thee with the view thereof.	
	
    Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain;	
	
    Even to the note o' th' King, or I'll fall in them.	
	
    Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.	
	
    Even with the rebels' blood. But what mean I	
	
    Ever love Caesar so?	
	
    Every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes	
	
    Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,	
	
    Except this city now by us besieg'd-	
	
    Except, O Signieur, thou do give to me	
	
    Exeunt	
	
    Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,	
	
    Expos'd unto the sea, which hath requit it,	
	
    Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,	
	
    Fails in the promis'd largeness; checks and disasters	
	
    Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.                Exeunt	
	
    Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me	
	
    Faith infringed which such zeal did swear?	
	
    Fall down before him like the mower's swath.	
	
    Fall to the base earth from the firmament!	
	
    False to his children and his wife's allies;	
	
    Falstaff.	
	
    Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;	
	
    Farewell nobility! Let his Grace go forward	
	
    Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,	
	
    Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not-	
	
    Farewell, old Gaunt; thy sometimes brother's wife,	
	
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!	
	
    Fast to the chair. Be heedful; hence, and watch.	
	
    Fates open their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;	
	
    Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;	
	
    Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?	
	
    Fed in heart, whose flames aspire,	
	
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,	
	
    Fell from their boughs, and left me open, bare	
	
    Fenton,	
	
    Fetch us in fuel. And be quick, thou 'rt best,	
	
    Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself;	
	
    Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;	
	
    Figuring the natures of the times deceas'd;	
	
    Fills the wide vessel of the universe.	
	
    Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail;	
	
    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,	
	
    Finely put on indeed!	
	
    First note that he is near you in descent,	
	
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,	
	
    First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,	
	
    First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me	
	
    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.	
	
    Fled from her wish and yet said, "Now I may";	
	
    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;	
	
    Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:	
	
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,	
	
    Follow my heels, Rugby.               Exeunt CAIUS and RUGBY	
	
    Follow your spirit; and upon this charge	
	
    Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter.	
	
    For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,	
	
    For 'tis to such a thing-	
	
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,	
	
    For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd	
	
    For God's sake, cousin, stay till all come in.	
	
    For I am all the subjects that you have,	
	
    For I am fresh of spirit and resolved	
	
    For I am she, and altogether joyless.	
	
    For I by vow am so embodied yours	
	
    For I come hither arm'd against myself.	
	
    For I have bought it with an hundred blows.	
	
    For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,	
	
    For I intend to have it ere long.	
	
    For I must tell you friendly in your ear:	
	
    For I upon this bank will rest my head.	
	
    For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.	
	
    For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,	
	
    For Mowbray and myself are like two men	
	
    For Time is like a fashionable host,	
	
    For a second course of fight.	
	
    For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.	
	
    For all the world like cutler's poetry	
	
    For as the sun is daily new and old,	
	
    For aye thy foot-licker.	
	
    For being now a favourer to the Briton,	
	
    For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;	
	
    For by my mother I derived am	
	
    For certain drops of salt, your city Rome-	
	
    For courage mounteth with occasion.	
	
    For did I but suspect a fearful man,	
	
    For doughty-handed are you, and have fought	
	
    For even the breath of what I mean to speak	
	
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,	
	
    For every minute is expectancy	
	
    For fear of that I still will stay with thee	
	
    For folly that he wisely shows is fit;	
	
    For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me	
	
    For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;	
	
    For he can do no more than Caesar's arm	
	
    For he is but a bastard to the time	
	
    For he is set so only to himself	
	
    For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.	
	
    For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter	
	
    For her sake that I have been-for I feel	
	
    For him, and in his right, we hold this town.	
	
    For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,	
	
    For honesty and decent carriage,	
	
    For if of joy, being altogether wanting,	
	
    For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.	
	
    For in the temple, by and by, with us	
	
    For it doth physic love- of his content,	
	
    For it is you that puts us to our shifts.	
	
    For judgment only doth belong to Thee.	
	
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,	
	
    For look you, I may make the belly smile	
	
    For many carriages he hath dispatch'd	
	
    For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself.	
	
    For more than blushing comes to. If your back	
	
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak	
	
    For my prosperity!                                  [Kneels]	
	
    For native blood is counted painting now;	
	
    For night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing.	
	
    For nothing can be ill if she be well.	
	
    For now he lives in fame, though not in life.	
	
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.	
	
    For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt	
	
    For our beloved mother in her pains.	
	
    For patience she will prove a second Grissel,	
	
    For pity is the virtue of the law,	
	
    For revels, dances, masks, and merry hours,	
	
    For ruin's wasteful entrance; there, the murtherers,	
	
    For she had a tongue with a tang,	
	
    For she is wise, if I can judge of her,	
	
    For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,	
	
    For so we are inform'd-with new opinions,	
	
    For some displeasing service I have done,	
	
    For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid	
	
    For such an injury would vex a very saint;	
	
    For suff'rance is the badge of all our tribe;	
	
    For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes.	
	
    For that I have laid by my majesty	
	
    For that it stands not in such warlike brace,	
	
    For that my sovereign liege was in my debt	
	
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,	
	
    For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!	
	
    For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,	
	
    For the remembrance of my father's death.	
	
    For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,	
	
    For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,	
	
    For then, and not till then, he felt himself,	
	
    For there young Henry with his nobles lie.	
	
    For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free	
	
    For thine own future safety.	
	
    For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.	
	
    For this poor furniture and mean array.	
	
    For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.	
	
    For thou exists on many a thousand grains	
	
    For thou hast made it like a humble suppliant.	
	
    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,	
	
    For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,	
	
    For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,	
	
    For too much loving you.	
	
    For trust not him that hath once broken faith-	
	
    For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.	
	
    For we no longer are defensible.	
	
    For we will make for Ireland presently.	
	
    For well you know here comes in embassy	
	
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,	
	
    For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,	
	
    For when my outward action doth demonstrate	
	
    For where thou art, there is the world itself,	
	
    For which the people stir; if you will pass	
	
    For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd:	
	
    For why, the senseless brands will sympathize	
	
    For women are as roses, whose fair flow'r	
	
    For yet may England curse my wretched reign.	
	
    For you serve knaves.                                   Exit	
	
    For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself	
	
    For your desire to know what is between us,	
	
    For your partaker Pole, and you yourself,	
	
    For, being green, there is great hope of help.	
	
    For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,	
	
    For, if they could, Cupid himself would blush	
	
    For, knowing thee to be but young and light-	
	
    For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,	
	
    Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer,	
	
    Forc'd in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?	
	
    Ford.	
	
    Foretold should be his last-full of repentance,	
	
    Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed:	
	
    Forgo the easier.	
	
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;	
	
    Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great	
	
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;	
	
    Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,	
	
    Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about	
	
    Four rogues in buckram let drive at me.	
	
    France, Kate, but in loving me you should love the friend of	
	
    Free pardon to each man that has denied	
	
    Freely to render what we have in charge;	
	
    Fret fetlock deep in gore, and with wild rage	
	
    Friendship is constant in all other things	
	
    From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,	
	
    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.	
	
    From action and adventure?	
	
    From change of fortune. Why this spade, this place?	
	
    From false to false, among false maids in love,	
	
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes	
	
    From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!	
	
    From him that fled some strange indignity,	
	
    From me, the lord on't.	
	
    From most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus,	
	
    From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.	
	
    From out the circle of his territories.	
	
    From reason's yielding, your fair self should make	
	
    From such a filthy vice; say to thyself	
	
    From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet	
	
    From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash	
	
    From the report that goes upon your goodness;	
	
    From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;	
	
    From this day to the ending of the world,	
	
    From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war	
	
    From whence he intercepted did return	
	
    From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest	
	
    From which awak'd, the truth of what we are	
	
    From women's eyes this doctrine I derive.	
	
    Full of crusadoes; and, but my noble Moor	
	
    Full of protest, of oath, and big compare,	
	
    Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.	
	
    Further I say, and further will maintain	
	
    Gan in your duller Britain operate	
	
    Garter.	
	
    Gave't you the King?	
	
    Genoa-	
	
    Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.	
	
    Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.	
	
    Give her the right you should have giv'n her cousin,	
	
    Give him that parting kiss which I had set	
	
    Give me a case to put my visage in.	
	
    Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There,	
	
    Give me my sword.	
	
    Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?	
	
    Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give;	
	
    Give me your hand, Bassanio; fare you well.	
	
    Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me	
	
    Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.	
	
    Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard	
	
    Give you a reason on compulsion? If reasons were as plentiful as	
	
    Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.	
	
    Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull	
	
    Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,	
	
    Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.	
	
    Go cheerfully together and digest	
	
    Go down upon him, you have power enough,	
	
    Go in to Troy, and say there 'Hector's dead.'	
	
    Go on. I'll follow thee.	
	
    Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.        Exeunt	
	
    Go thou toward home, where I will never come	
	
    Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.	
	
    Go with me to a notary, seal me there	
	
    Go with your impositions, I am yours	
	
    Go you to him from me.	
	
    Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;	
	
    Go, hop me over every kennel home,	
	
    Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour,	
	
    God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!           Exeunt	
	
    God for his mercy, what treachery is here!	
	
    God is to be worshipp'd; all men are not alike, alas, good	
	
    God pless your Majesty!	
	
    God save the King! although I be not he;	
	
    God should be so obdurate as yourselves,	
	
    God witness with me, when I here came in	
	
    God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.	
	
    Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,	
	
    Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!	
	
    Good Kate; I am a gentleman.	
	
    Good boy, wink at me, and say thou saw'st me not. Fare thee well.	
	
    Good for their meat and safer for their lives.	
	
    Good king, to be so mightily abused!	
	
    Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.	
	
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.	
	
    Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes!

    Grant I may ever love, and rather woo	
	
    Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply	
	
    Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried	
	
    Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;	
	
    Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!	
	
    Grew fat with feasting there.	
	
    Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours.	
	
    Grow great by your example and put on	
	
    Guard her till Caesar come.                             Exit	
	
    HORTENSIUS	
	
    Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is	
	
    Had I before known this young man his son,	
	
    Had I so lavish of my presence been,	
	
    Had been incorporate. So we grew together,	
	
    Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;	
	
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.	
	
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,	
	
    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.	
	
    Had still kept loyal to possession	
	
    Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that	
	
    Hadst thou but lov'd him half so well as I,	
	
    Hail, King of Scotland!	
	
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;	
	
    Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,	
	
    Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow,	
	
    Haply the seas, and countries different,	
	
    Hardly conceive of me-let it be nois'd	
	
    Hark ye, lords. You see I have given her physic,	
	
    Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,	
	
    Hark, slave, it is but this:	
	
    Harry, how fares your uncle?	
	
    Has forgot Britain.	
	
    Has much disgrac'd me in't; I'm angry at him,	
	
    Hast strangely stood the test; here, afore heaven,	
	
    Hast thou tapp'd out, and drunkenly carous'd.	
	
    Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;	
	
    Hath a distracted and most wretched being,	
	
    Hath an aspect of intercession which	
	
    Hath been enacted through your enmity;	
	
    Hath but a losing office, and his tongue	
	
    Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!	
	
    Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,	
	
    Hath from the number of his banish'd years	
	
    Hath he conversed with the enemy,	
	
    Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive	
	
    Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,	
	
    Hath made his meal on thee?	
	
    Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,	
	
    Hath nature that in time will venom breed,	
	
    Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?	
	
    Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas	
	
    Hath promis'd me to help me to another,	
	
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.	
	
    Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already.	
	
    Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves;	
	
    Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?	
	
    Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,	
	
    Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school,	
	
    Have I dispursed to the garrisons,	
	
    Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,	
	
    Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal.	
	
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,	
	
    Have any resting for her true King's queen.	
	
    Have been mine so that evermore they pointed	
	
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre	
	
    Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied	
	
    Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice	
	
    Have found him guilty of high treason. Much	
	
    Have gloz'd, but superficially; not much	
	
    Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,	
	
    Have lost my daughter.	
	
    Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.	
	
    Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,	
	
    Have notice what we purpose. I shall break	
	
    Have other some. Why, 'tis a happy thing	
	
    Have sent a dozen sequent messengers	
	
    Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.	
	
    Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard	
	
    Have thus proceeded.	
	
    Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?	
	
    Have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride!	
	
    Have we not lost most part of all the towns,	
	
    Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know	
	
    Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,	
	
    Having alike your cause? Of this my letters	
	
    Having his ear full of his airy fame,	
	
    Having some business, do entreat her eyes	
	
    He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.	
	
    He be as miserably slain as I.	
	
    He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,	
	
    He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,	
	
    He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy;	
	
    He could not stay to pick them in a pile	
	
    He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;	
	
    He dies that touches any of this fruit	
	
    He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,	
	
    He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,	
	
    He followed you; for love I followed him;	
	
    He gives the bastinado with his tongue;	
	
    He had been abroad, carousing to his mates	
	
    He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have	
	
    He hath a person and a smooth dispose	
	
    He hath been in unusual pleasure and	
	
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message	
	
    He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?	
	
    He is a man, setting his fate aside,	
	
    He is gone happy, and has left me rich.	
	
    He is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it	
	
    He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,	
	
    He knits his brow and shows an angry eye	
	
    He like a puling cuckold would drink up	
	
    He little cares for, and a daughter who	
	
    He may a little grieve at.	
	
    He might have chid me so, for in good faith,	
	
    He must not be my brother.	
	
    He needs must see himself.	
	
    He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,	
	
    He prettily and aptly taunts himself.	
	
    He rather means to lodge you in the field,	
	
    He says he does, being then most flattered.	
	
    He shall again relate.	
	
    He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,	
	
    He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;	
	
    He should have brav'd the east an hour ago.	
	
    He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine;	
	
    He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all	
	
    He swore consent to your succession,	
	
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget	
	
    He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,	
	
    He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves;	
	
    He told me that rebellion had bad luck,	
	
    He was a thing of blood, whose every motion	
	
    He was from thence discharg'd? Sir, call to mind	
	
    He was not taken well: he had not din'd;	
	
    He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,	
	
    He will be here, and yet he is not here.	
	
    He would have well becom'd this place and grac'd	
	
    He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.	
	
    He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.	
	
    He'll tell me all his purpose. Sure, he'll come.	
	
    He's a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often	
	
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to	
	
    He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer	
	
    He- to give fear to use and liberty,	
	
    Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell	
	
    Hear patiently my purpose. I'll disrobe me	
	
    Heard many grievous-I do say, my lord,	
	
    Hearing us praise our loves of Italy	
	
    Heave him away upon your winged thoughts	
	
    Heaven give you many, many merry days!	
	
    Heaven prosper the right! What weapons is he?	
	
    Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!	
	
    Hector's great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens.	
	
    Held current music too.	
	
    Help, friends below! Let's draw him hither.	
	
    Hence hath offence his quick celerity,	
	
    Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves.	
	
    Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.	
	
    Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,	
	
    Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,	
	
    Her aid she promis'd and assur'd success.	
	
    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,	
	
    Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd	
	
    Her father hath commanded her to slip	
	
    Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd. All	
	
    Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page;	
	
    Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu'd	
	
    Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,	
	
    Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.	
	
    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;	
	
    Her virtues, graced with external gifts,	
	
    Her words doth show her wit incomparable;	
	
    Here at more leisure may your Highness read,	
	
    Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she's a fair lady! I do spy	
	
    Here comes one.	
	
    Here did she fall a tear; here in this place	
	
    Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!	
	
    Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,	
	
    Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice;	
	
    Here is a man-but 'tis before his face;	
	
    Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad	
	
    Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,	
	
    Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors	
	
    Here sits a king more woeful than you are.	
	
    Here was a royal fellowship of death!	
	
    Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen,	
	
    Here's goodly work!	
	
    Here's to thy health.	
	
    Here, on my knee, I beg mortality,	
	
    Here, you maid! Where's my cousin Cressid?	
	
    Herein misled by your suggestion.	
	
    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,	
	
    Hie you to church; I must another way,	
	
    High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.	
	
    Him that thou magnifi'st with all these tides,	
	
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads	
	
    His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,	
	
    His accusations.	
	
    His answer was, the people were not used	
	
    His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.	
	
    His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,	
	
    His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,	
	
    His contemplation were above the earth	
	
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,	
	
    His days are foul and his drink dangerous.	
	
    His eye-balls further out than when he liv'd,	
	
    His father by as much as a performance	
	
    His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this;	
	
    His givings-out were of an infinite distance	
	
    His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,	
	
    His guard have brought him thither.	
	
    His heart, like an agate, with your print impressed,	
	
    His issue disinherited should be;	
	
    His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.	
	
    His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,	
	
    His marches are expedient to this town,	
	
    His noble cousin is right welcome hither;	
	
    His own life hung upon the staff he threw-	
	
    His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if	
	
    His power unto Octavia.	
	
    His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit	
	
    His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,	
	
    His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march;	
	
    His son was but a ward two years ago.	
	
    His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops	
	
    His thinkings are below the moon, not worth	
	
    His uncle York- where I first bow'd my knee	
	
    His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,	
	
    His youngest son- and would not change that calling	
	
    Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men	
	
    Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child,	
	
    Hold, take my ring.	
	
    Holding Corioli in the name of Rome	
	
    Holds honour far more precious dear than life.	
	
    Home to your cottages, forsake this groom;	
	
    Hop forty paces through the public street;	
	
    Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair	
	
    Horses did neigh and dying men did groan,	
	
    How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,	
	
    How I have thought of this and of these times,	
	
    How all occasions do inform against me	
	
    How can she be with him? When was she miss'd?	
	
    How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,	
	
    How could he see to do them? Having made one,	
	
    How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?	
	
    How does your patient, doctor?	
	
    How doth the good knight? May I ask how my lady his wife doth?	
	
    How easy is it then! Your constancy	
	
    How fine my master is! I am afraid	
	
    How foul it is; what rank diseases grow,	
	
    How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,	
	
    How he received you. Let me be resolved.	
	
    How in our voiding-lobby hast thou stood	
	
    How is't with me, when every noise appals me?	
	
    How little is the cost I have bestowed	
	
    How many days will finish up the year,	
	
    How many things by season season'd are	
	
    How might a prince of my great hopes forget	
	
    How much her Grace is alter'd on the sudden?	
	
    How much the quantity, the weight as much	
	
    How now O What hath befall'n?	
	
    How now, Lord Stanley! What's the news?	
	
    How now, Ulysses!	
	
    How now, fair maid?	
	
    How now, who's there?	
	
    How now, young man! Mean'st thou to fight to-day?	
	
    How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours;	
	
    How say you, madam? Are ye so content?	
	
    How shall we do for money for these wars?	
	
    How should I be reveng'd? If this be true-	
	
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself	
	
    How these things came about. So shall You hear	
	
    How thou cam'st here thou mayst.	
	
    How to live better. For your stubborn answer	
	
    How were I then uplifted! but, alas,	
	
    How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur'd,	
	
    How youngly he began to serve his country,	
	
    Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.	
	
    Hubert shall be your man, attend on you	
	
    Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts	
	
    I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,	
	
    I am a king that find thee; and I know	
	
    I am a lamb; but if you brave the Moor,	
	
    I am a soldier and now bound to France.	
	
    I am afraid my daughter will run mad,	
	
    I am as true as truth's simplicity,	
	
    I am betrayed by keeping company	
	
    I am content to be Lucentio,	
	
    I am fall'n indeed.	
	
    I am gone.                                              Exit	
	
    I am his fortune's vassal and I send him	
	
    I am less proud to hear you tell my worth	
	
    I am no loathsome leper- look on me.	
	
    I am not in the giving vein to-day.	
	
    I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,	
	
    I am provided of a torch-bearer.	
	
    I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.	
	
    I am sure you have. Speak truth; y'are honest men.	
	
    I am that flower-	
	
    I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!	
	
    I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.	
	
    I am to thank you for't.	
	
    I am yet come to town. There's for your silence.	
	
    I am your better, traitors as ye are;	
	
    I and my sword will earn our chronicle.	
	
    I barely gratify your love; they failing,	
	
    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.	
	
    I better brook the loss of brittle life	
	
    I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,	
	
    I can add colours to the chameleon,	
	
    I can no other answer make but thanks,	
	
    I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?	
	
    I cannot fight upon this argument;	
	
    I cannot justify whom the law condemns.	
	
    I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?	
	
    I cannot truly say how I came here,	
	
    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.	
	
    I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,	
	
    I come by note, to give and to receive.	
	
    I come to observe; I give thee warning on't.	
	
    I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee.	
	
    I could do more to do Antonius good,	
	
    I could not sleep.	
	
    I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise	
	
    I dare not say from the rich Cardinal,	
	
    I did but tell her she mistook her frets,	
	
    I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,	
	
    I did. I  will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit; but-	
	
    I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,	
	
    I do beseech you, take it not amiss:	
	
    I do defy him, and I spit at him,	
	
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much	
	
    I do not know the man I should avoid	
	
    I do not like these several councils, I.	
	
    I do perceive't. There's nothing in her yet.	
	
    I do remember how my father said	
	
    I doubt not but to ride as fast as York;	
	
    I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit	
	
    I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;	
	
    I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,	
	
    I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn,	
	
    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched	
	
    I find my zenith doth depend upon	
	
    I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.	
	
    I found by fortune and did give my husband,	
	
    I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.	
	
    I go to certify her Talbot's here.	
	
    I greet your honours from Andronicus-	
	
    I had a feigned letter of my master's	
	
    I had forgot them- were two winking Cupids	
	
    I had my father's signet in my purse,	
	
    I had rather have my wounds to heal again	
	
    I had thought I had had men of some understanding	
	
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins	
	
    I have a truant been to chivalry;	
	
    I have an hour's talk in store for you;	
	
    I have bethought me of another fault.	
	
    I have cause, and smile at no man's jests; eat when I have	
	
    I have done enough. A lower place, note well,	
	
    I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part	
	
    I have gone all night. Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.	
	
    I have kept you next my heart; have not alone	
	
    I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,	
	
    I have myself resolv'd upon a course	
	
    I have no mind of feasting forth to-night;	
	
    I have not been desirous of their wealth,	
	
    I have not yet made known to Mariana	
	
    I have retir'd me to a wasteful cock	
	
    I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld	
	
    I have spoke this to know if your affiance	
	
    I have tir'd myself, and for two nights together	
	
    I have with such provision in mine art	
	
    I hear him near.	
	
    I heard thee say even now, thou like'st not that,	
	
    I here importune death awhile, until	
	
    I here resign my government to thee,	
	
    I hope it is some pardon or reprieve	
	
    I humbly set it at your will; but for my mistress,	
	
    I kiss his conquring hand. Tell him I am prompt	
	
    I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know	
	
    I know I am too mean to be your queen,	
	
    I know his noble nature-not to let	
	
    I know not by what power I am made bold,	
	
    I know not what he shall. God send him well!	
	
    I know the boy will well usurp the grace,	
	
    I know this act shows horrible and grim.	
	
    I know you think to dine with me to-day,	
	
    I lay me down a little while to breathe;	
	
    I led them on in this distracted fear,	
	
    I like you, lads; about your business straight;	
	
    I lov'd the maid I married; never man	
	
    I love thee, and 'tis my love that speaks-	
	
    I love you now; but till now not so much	
	
    I may avoid him. Which of these is he?	
	
    I may dispose of him.	
	
    I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.	
	
    I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms	
	
    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd	
	
    I moralize two meanings in one word.	
	
    I must be brief, lest resolution drop	
	
    I must begin with rudiments of art,	
	
    I must needs say you have a little fault.	
	
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours	
	
    I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir	
	
    I never did like molestation view	
	
    I never prosper'd since I forswore myself at primero. Well,	
	
    I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,	
	
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.	
	
    I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures	
	
    I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,	
	
    I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him	
	
    I pray you, bring me on the way a little,	
	
    I pray you, turn the key, and keep our counsel.             Exit.	
	
    I prithee do not strive against my vows.	
	
    I prithee, call him back.	
	
    I promise you my soul is very jocund	
	
    I promise you, but for your company,	
	
    I rather will subject me to the malice	
	
    I render for my brethren's obsequies;	
	
    I saw him beat the surges under him,	
	
    I saw our party to their trenches driven,	
	
    I say it shall be so.	
	
    I say! Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt he be	
	
    I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.	
	
    I see a yielding in the looks of France;	
	
    I see thee yet, in form as palpable	
	
    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.	
	
    I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?	
	
    I shall be lov'd when I am lack'd. Nay, mother,	
	
    I shall ever see thee again or no, there is nobody cares.	
	
    I shall obey you in an fair commands.	
	
    I shall unfold equal discourtesy	
	
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.	
	
    I should do thus.                                 [Flourish]	
	
    I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'	
	
    I should make very forges of my cheeks,	
	
    I should rejoice now at this happy news;	
	
    I slew him not, but to my own disgrace	
	
    I speak it in my spirit and honour, 'No.'	
	
    I speak of peace while covert emnity,	
	
    I stand for judgment; answer; shall I have it?	
	
    I stood engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd	
	
    I swear 'tis better to be much abused	
	
    I tell thee	
	
    I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.	
	
    I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths	
	
    I thank you for your pains; spend this for me.	
	
    I thank you princes for my daughter's death.	
	
    I think he hath a very fair warning.	
	
    I think she stirs again. No. What's best to do?	
	
    I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.	
	
    I thought my mother and my brother York	
	
    I thought you lord of more true gentleness.	
	
    I told him of your stealth unto this wood.	
	
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.	
	
    I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word	
	
    I visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire. I have him already	
	
    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,	
	
    I was a chaste wife to my grave. Embalm me,	
	
    I was enforc'd to send it after him;	
	
    I was your mother much upon these years	
	
    I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute	
	
    I will assume thy part in some disguise	
	
    I will be correspondent to command,	
	
    I will be thine; and, till that instant, shut	
	
    I will believe thou hast a mind that suits	
	
    I will bring thee where Mistress Anne Page is, at a a	
	
    I will confirm with oath; which I doubt not	
	
    I will enforce it eas'ly to my love.	
	
    I will example it:	
	
    I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia	
	
    I will maintain it with some little cost.	
	
    I will no further chide you.	
	
    I will not bed her.	
	
    I will not fail her; speak it privately.	
	
    I will not reason what is meant hereby,	
	
    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and	
	
    I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for't.	
	
    I will some other be- some Florentine,	
	
    I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;	
	
    I will your serious and great business scant	
	
    I wish'd might fall on me when I was found	
	
    I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,	
	
    I would applaud thee to the very echo,	
	
    I would be trebled twenty times myself,	
	
    I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to	
	
    I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all	
	
    I would my valiant master would destroy thee.	
	
    I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,	
	
    I would not kill thy unprepared spirit.	
	
    I would not, so with love I might entreat you,	
	
    I would on great occasion speak with you.            Exit Cassio.	
	
    I would the college of the Cardinals	
	
    I would thou hadst told me of another father.	
	
    I would, false murd'rous coward, on thy knee	
	
    I' th' dungeon by a snuff?	
	
    I' th' field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be	
	
    I' th' war do grow together; grant that, and tell me	
	
    I'd play incessantly upon these jades,	
	
    I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,	
	
    I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,	
	
    I'll beat thee- but I should infect my hands.	
	
    I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.	
	
    I'll come to you anon.	
	
    I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.	
	
    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]	
	
    I'll find about the making of the bed;	
	
    I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all	
	
    I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee;	
	
    I'll hang my head and perish.	
	
    I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.	
	
    I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary	
	
    I'll hide me.                                          Exit.	
	
    I'll keep, if but for sympathy.	
	
    I'll lend you thus much moneys'?	
	
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-	
	
    I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,	
	
    I'll never do you wrong for your own sake.	
	
    I'll not believe't.	
	
    I'll not endure it. You forget yourself	
	
    I'll over then to England with this news,	
	
    I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him.	
	
    I'll put it to the issue.                                  Exeunt	
	
    I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,	
	
    I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail	
	
    I'll shave your crown for this,	
	
    I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,	
	
    I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.	
	
    I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death.	
	
    I'll thither. What thing is't that I never	
	
    I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.	
	
    I'll venture one have-at-him.	
	
    I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,	
	
    I'll wink and couch; no man their works must eye.	
	
    I, after him, do after him wish too,	
	
    I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth	
	
    Iago, look with care about the town,	
	
    If Cassius might have ruled.	
	
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,	
	
    If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;	
	
    If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;	
	
    If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold	
	
    If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.	
	
    If I myself, there is no hour so fit	
	
    If I refuse to wed Demetrius.	
	
    If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,	
	
    If I would time expend with such a snipe	
	
    If after every tempest come such calms,	
	
    If all the year were playing holidays,	
	
    If any thing more than your sport and pleasure	
	
    If by the way they be not fought withal.	
	
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so	
	
    If ever I did dream of such a matter,	
	
    If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster	
	
    If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,	
	
    If guilty dread have left thee so much strength	
	
    If haply you my father do suspect	
	
    If he had gone forth consul, found it so.	
	
    If he should still malignantly remain	
	
    If he were that which now he's like-that's dead;	
	
    If his occasion were not virtuous	
	
    If it be husbanded with modesty.	
	
    If it could so roar to me. I cut off's head,	
	
    If it were so that our request did tend	
	
    If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,	
	
    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear	
	
    If not fill up the measure of her will,	
	
    If not to bless us and the land withal,	
	
    If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.	
	
    If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes	
	
    If one good deed in all my life I did,	
	
    If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,	
	
    If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day	
	
    If so, I have derision med'cinable	
	
    If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,	
	
    If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.	
	
    If that the youth of my new int'rest here	
	
    If that thy bent of love be honourable,	
	
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,	
	
    If there be one among the fair'st of Greece	
	
    If these shows be not outward, which of you	
	
    If they set down before's, for the remove	
	
    If they will fight with us, bid them come down	
	
    If this same were a churchyard where we stand,	
	
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,	
	
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,	
	
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,	
	
    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,	
	
    If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;	
	
    If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,	
	
    If thou would have such a one, take me; and take me, take a	
	
    If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive	
	
    If truth and upright innocency fail me,	
	
    If we be not, show us the hand of God	
	
    If we, without his help, can make a head	
	
    If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with;	
	
    If worthier friends had not prevented me.	
	
    If you be maid or no?	
	
    If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,	
	
    If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries	
	
    If you give place to accidental evils.	
	
    If you have any pity, grace, or manners,	
	
    If you shall send them word you will not come,	
	
    If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.	
	
    If you will patiently dance in our round,	
	
    If you would walk in absence of the sun.	
	
    If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,	
	
    Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,	
	
    Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.	
	
    Immediately to marry; she hath consented.	
	
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,	
	
    Impose me to what penance your invention	
	
    In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen;	
	
    In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make	
	
    In Hector's wrath.	
	
    In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves,	
	
    In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,	
	
    In a sweet verbal brief it did concern	
	
    In all my writings. Go with me, and see	
	
    In all this presence that hath mov'd me so.	
	
    In any breast of strong authority	
	
    In argument of praise, or to the worth	
	
    In best appointment all our regiments.	
	
    In borrow'd robes?	
	
    In coffins from the field; and at this day	
	
    In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,	
	
    In courtesy gives undeserving praise.	
	
    In diet, in affections of delight,	
	
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,	
	
    In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!	
	
    In end of autumn turned to the rams;	
	
    In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place	
	
    In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk.	
	
    In feeding them with those my former fortunes	
	
    In fortune's love? For then the bold and coward,	
	
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,	
	
    In heavy satisfaction, and would never	
	
    In her strong toil of grace.	
	
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,	
	
    In honestest defence.	
	
    In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,	
	
    In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence	
	
    In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.	
	
    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.	
	
    In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters	
	
    In mortal fury half so peremptory	
	
    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd	
	
    In my profession? Knighthoods and honours borne	
	
    In number more than ever women spoke,	
	
    In our heart's table-heart too capable	
	
    In parcels as I did, would have gone near	
	
    In peace there's nothing so becomes a man	
	
    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;	
	
    In private will I talk with thee apart.	
	
    In purity of manhood stand upright,	
	
    In reckoning up the several devils' names	
	
    In secret ambush on the forest side	
	
    In shape no bigger than an agate stone	
	
    In sleep I heard him say, "Sweet Desdemona,	
	
    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.	
	
    In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,	
	
    In strange concealments, valiant as a lion,	
	
    In such a justling time? Who leads his power?	
	
    In supplication nod; and my young boy	
	
    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,	
	
    In that each of you have forsworn his book,	
	
    In the Rialto you have rated me	
	
    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.	
	
    In the extremity of great and little	
	
    In the poison'd entrails throw.	
	
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,	
	
    In the unshrinking station where he fought,	
	
    In thee't had been good service. Thou must know	
	
    In their embracement, as they grew together;	
	
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,	
	
    In this day's council; but we'll take tomorrow.	
	
    In this sad wreck? How came't? Who is't? What art thou?	
	
    In this time of the night? Bring him away;	
	
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?	
	
    In truth I know not. I was set at work	
	
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,	
	
    In weeping after this untimely bier.                  Exeunt	
	
    In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;	
	
    In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?	
	
    In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd	
	
    In your fine frame hath love no quality?	
	
    Incapable of more, replete with you,	
	
    Indeed his king) to be engag'd in Wales,	
	
    Infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain	
	
    Infortunate in nothing but in thee.	
	
    Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather	
	
    Injurious time now with a robber's haste	
	
    Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself:	
	
    Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,	
	
    Intends his journey, and within three days	
	
    Into baboon and monkey.	
	
    Into his study of imagination,	
	
    Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,	
	
    Into the chantry by; there, before him	
	
    Into the harsh and boist'rous tongue of war;	
	
    Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.	
	
    Into three limits very equally.	
	
    Invites me in this churlish messenger.	
	
    Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?	
	
    Is Fulvia's death.	
	
    Is added to her wounds. I think withal	
	
    Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?	
	
    Is as 'twere born so.	
	
    Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.	
	
    Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.	
	
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,	
	
    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'	
	
    Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,	
	
    Is foul as slander.	
	
    Is full of weeds; her fairest flowers chok'd up,	
	
    Is hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself;	
	
    Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?	
	
    Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.	
	
    Is it not more than shame to shame it so?	
	
    Is led on in the conduct of my will;	
	
    Is likely to beget more conquerors,	
	
    Is mortals' chiefest enemy.	
	
    Is my strict fast-I mean my children's looks;	
	
    Is not Gaunt dead? and doth not Hereford live?	
	
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.	
	
    Is not this something more than fantasy?	
	
    Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,	
	
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,	
	
    Is only Helena. To her, my lord,	
	
    Is poison to thy stomach.	
	
    Is resty grown; he bade me take a trumpet	
	
    Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man	
	
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?	
	
    Is spied in populous cities.	
	
    Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood	
	
    Is that an answer?	
	
    Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire	
	
    Is the immediate jewel of their souls.	
	
    Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?	
	
    Is this a dagger which I see before me,	
	
    Is this the fashions in the court of England?	
	
    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.	
	
    Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood	
	
    Is to remove proud Somerset from the King,	
	
    Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,	
	
    Is warm'd by th' rest and takes it thankfully.	
	
    Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,	
	
    Is't come to this? Well, well.	
	
    Is't possible that my deserts to you	
	
    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,	
	
    It can do me no damage'; adding further	
	
    It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.	
	
    It could not move thus.	
	
    It doth appear you are a worthy judge;	
	
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it	
	
    It hath struck ten o'clock.	
	
    It ill beseems this presence to cry aim	
	
    It is a creature that I teach to fight,	
	
    It is a recreation to be by	
	
    It is an attribute to God himself;	
	
    It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,	
	
    It is my lady; O, it is my love!	
	
    It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate	
	
    It is not worth leave-taking.	
	
    It is supposed the fair creature died-	
	
    It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,	
	
    It is the soldier's: I, by bargain, should	
	
    It it rain'd down fortune show'ring on your head,	
	
    It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches	
	
    It may lie gently at the foot of peace	
	
    It must not be with this.	
	
    It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it	
	
    It shall advantage more than do us wrong.	
	
    It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,	
	
    It shall become thee well to act my woes:	
	
    It skills not much; we'll fit him to our turn-	
	
    It stands as an edict in destiny.	
	
    It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.	
	
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,	
	
    It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.	
	
    It were convenient you had such a devil.	
	
    It will go hard with poor Antonio.	
	
    It would amaze the proudest of you all.	
	
    It would not out at windows nor at doors.	
	
    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be	
	
    Jack, meet me to-morrow in the Temple Hall	
	
    Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,	
	
    John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt;	
	
    John. By the mass, I have drunk too much sack at supper. A good	
	
    Join'd in commission with him, but either	
	
    Joy'd are we that you are.	
	
    Jupiter, a swan, for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love!	
	
    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-	
	
    Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am glad thou	
	
    Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit	
	
    Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!	
	
    Keeps honour bright. To have done is to hang	
	
    Kept him a foreign man still; which so griev'd him	
	
    Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,	
	
    Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour	
	
    King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear	
	
    King and commander of our commonweal,	
	
    King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolv'd,	
	
    King.	
	
    Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have	
	
    Kneel'd at my feet, and bid me be advis'd?	
	
    Knit earth and heaven together!	
	
    Know what it is to meet Achilles angry.	
	
    Know you not, master, to some kind of men	
	
    Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,	
	
    Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,	
	
    LUCILIUS	
	
    Lady Hero's chamber window.	
	
    Lamenting some enforced chastity.	
	
    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,	
	
    Last time I danc'd attendance on his will	
	
    Launcelot?	
	
    Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house.	
	
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul	
	
    Lead him off.                             Exit Montano, attended.	
	
    Lead their successes as we wish our own,	
	
    Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.	
	
    Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,	
	
    Leave us.	
	
    Leaving no heir begotten of his body-	
	
    Led by the Dauphin.	
	
    Legitimation, name, and all is gone.	
	
    Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues-	
	
    Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,	
	
    Lest He that is the supreme King of kings	
	
    Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;	
	
    Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow	
	
    Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,	
	
    Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of	
	
    Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close;	
	
    Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,	
	
    Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,	
	
    Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;	
	
    Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart	
	
    Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!	
	
    Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example	
	
    Let him be whipt and hang'd.	
	
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.	
	
    Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,	
	
    Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong;	
	
    Let it not, Brutus.	
	
    Let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? How is't with you? What, man,	
	
    Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man	
	
    Let me entreat- for I command no more-	
	
    Let me in safety raise me from my knees,	
	
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell	
	
    Let me o'erleap that custom; for I cannot	
	
    Let me see: a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.	
	
    Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,	
	
    Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women	
	
    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.	
	
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,	
	
    Let them be welcome then; we are prepar'd.	
	
    Let them obey that knows not how to rule;	
	
    Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway	
	
    Let us be jocund; will you troll the catch	
	
    Let us die in honour: once more back again;	
	
    Let us not leave till all our own be won.	
	
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;	
	
    Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;	
	
    Let's dry our eyes; and thus far hear me, Cromwell,	
	
    Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.	
	
    Let's see once more this saying grav'd in gold:	
	
    Let's teach ourselves that honorable stop,	
	
    Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,	
	
    Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;	
	
    Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-	
	
    Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich	
	
    Lies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth,	
	
    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,	
	
    Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain	
	
    Like a bright exhalation in the evening,	
	
    Like a rich armour worn in heat of day	
	
    Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks	
	
    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;	
	
    Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou	
	
    Like interrupted waters, and o'erbear	
	
    Like one well studied in a sad ostent	
	
    Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,	
	
    Like syllable of dolor.	
	
    Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.	
	
    Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves	
	
    Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears	
	
    Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand	
	
    Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;	
	
    Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.	
	
    Live regist'red upon our brazen tombs,	
	
    Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;	
	
    Lives so in hope, as in an early spring	
	
    Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;	
	
    Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty	
	
    Loath to depose the child, your brother's son;	
	
    Lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not,	
	
    Long guard it yours!  [Kneeling]  If I affect it more	
	
    Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,	
	
    Look here, I throw my infamy at thee.	
	
    Look how I am bewitch'd; behold, mine arm	
	
    Look out, and speak to friends. Th' Athenians	
	
    Look that you take upon you as you should.	
	
    Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.	
	
    Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,	
	
    Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?	
	
    Look, here it is.	
	
    Look, where he comes!	
	
    Looks in a glass that shows what future evils-	
	
    Lord Chancellor in your place.	
	
    Lord Hastings was, for her delivery?	
	
    Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,	
	
    Lord, for thy justice!	
	
    Lords	
	
    Lords?	
	
    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;	
	
    Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.	
	
    Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.	
	
    Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!	
	
    Loves for his own ends, not for you.	
	
    Lucius our Emperor; for well I know	
	
    Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I	
	
    Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until	
	
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,	
	
    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.	
	
    Made by some other deity than Nature,	
	
    Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,	
	
    Made impudent with use of evil deeds,	
	
    Made me put this main secret in the packet	
	
    Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,	
	
    Made to the Queen to call back her appeal	
	
    Maintain my opinion.	
	
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,	
	
    Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.	
	
    Make haste, I say.	
	
    Make it so known.	
	
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,	
	
    Make mountains level, and the continent,	
	
    Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk paps	
	
    Make the sun dance. Hark you!               [A shout within]	
	
    Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we	
	
    Make us pay down for our offence by weight	
	
    Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,	
	
    Makes me afeard.	
	
    Makes me most forward in this princely presence	
	
    Makes us hear something.	
	
    Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,	
	
    Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep	
	
    Making you ever better than his praise	
	
    Many a battle have I won in France,	
	
    Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought	
	
    Many for many virtues excellent,	
	
    March to assault thy country than to tread-	
	
    Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy	
	
    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead	
	
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,	
	
    Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport-	
	
    Marry that will, I live and die a maid.	
	
    Marry, would the word 'farewell' have length'ned hours	
	
    Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger	
	
    Master Smooth's the silkman. I pray you, since my exion is	
	
    Master, your love must live a maid at home;	
	
    May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;	
	
    May be beholding to a subject,	
	
    May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man	
	
    May fright the hopeful mother at the view,	
	
    May happily bring forth. But who comes here?	
	
    May justly diet me. I pray you yet-	
	
    May make it probable need.	
	
    May now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,	
	
    May prove his travel, not her danger.	
	
    May soon return to this our suffering country	
	
    May take off some extremity, which to read	
	
    May waste the memory of the former days.	
	
    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.	
	
    Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But alack,	
	
    Meantime let this defend my loyalty-	
	
    Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?	
	
    Meet I an infant of the house of York,	
	
    Meets with Lord Harry; and I fear, Sir Michael,	
	
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses	
	
    Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is.	
	
    Men's evil manners live in brass: their virtues	
	
    Mercy is not itself that oft looks so;	
	
    Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies	
	
    Metheglin, wort, and malmsey; well run dice!	
	
    Methinks I see a quick'ning in his eye.	
	
    Methinks he looks as though he were in love.	
	
    Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.	
	
    Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,	
	
    Might be a copy to these younger times;	
	
    Might happily have prov'd far worse than his.	
	
    Might in the ground be closed up in rest!	
	
    Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,	
	
    Millions of mischiefs.                               Exeunt.	
	
    Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart	
	
    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,	
	
    Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,	
	
    Mine were the very cipher of a function,	
	
    Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means.	
	
    Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.	
	
    Misus'd ere us'd, by times ill-us'd o'erpast.	
	
    Moe widows in them of this business' making,	
	
    Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;	
	
    More bright in zeal than the devotion which	
	
    More fierce and more inexorable far	
	
    More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends	
	
    More holy and profound, than mine own life,	
	
    More like a soldier than a man o' th' church,	
	
    More out of malice than integrity,	
	
    More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;	
	
    More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;	
	
    More sweet than our blest fields. His royal bird	
	
    More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing	
	
    More than mine own; that am, have, and will be-	
	
    More than remembrance of my father's death.             Exit	
	
    More than to see this ring. Take him away.	
	
    More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer	
	
    More upon humour than advis'd respect.	
	
    Moreover, urge his hateful luxury	
	
    Most busy, least when I do it.	
	
    Most dignifies the haver. If it be,	
	
    Most grossly by his own!	
	
    Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,	
	
    Most provident in peril, bind himself-	
	
    Most rich in Timon's nod.	
	
    Most welcome, sir!                             [They salute]	
	
    Mov'd with remorse of these outrageous broils,	
	
    Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!	
	
    Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.	
	
    Murd'ring impossibility, to make	
	
    Murder not then the fruit within my womb,	
	
    Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.	
	
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him	
	
    Must be boisterously maintain'd as gain'd,	
	
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,	
	
    Must end that work the ides of March begun.	
	
    Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure	
	
    Must have their voices; neither will they bate	
	
    Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,	
	
    Must shuffle for itself.	
	
    Must wear the print of his remembrance out,	
	
    Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;	
	
    My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,	
	
    My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,	
	
    My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,	
	
    My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;	
	
    My being here it is that holds thee hence.	
	
    My books and instruments shall be my company,	
	
    My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul-	
	
    My brother hath done well.	
	
    My chaplain to no creature living but	
	
    My conscience tells me you are innocent.	
	
    My custom always of the afternoon,	
	
    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die	
	
    My discontented peers! What! mother dead!	
	
    My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know	
	
    My fame is shrewdly gor'd.	
	
    My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,	
	
    My father had a daughter lov'd a man,	
	
    My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold;	
	
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!	
	
    My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,	
	
    My friends and brethren in these great affairs,	
	
    My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches	
	
    My grained ash an hundred times hath broke	
	
    My grief lies onward and my joy behind.	
	
    My head with more ill news, for it is fun.	
	
    My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;	
	
    My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.	
	
    My honour would not let ingratitude	
	
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.	
	
    My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,	
	
    My legs can keep no pace with my desires.	
	
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand	
	
    My lord desires you presently; my news	
	
    My lord, look here! Look here, Lavinia!	
	
    My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;	
	
    My love with words and errors still she feeds,	
	
    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer	
	
    My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;	
	
    My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.	
	
    My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.	
	
    My mother gave it me.	
	
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.	
	
    My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.	
	
    My numbers lessen'd; and those few I have	
	
    My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,	
	
    My purse, my person, my extremest means,	
	
    My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk;	
	
    My revenge properly, my remission lies	
	
    My sequent protestation: be thou true,	
	
    My sons would never so dishonour me.	
	
    My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.	
	
    My speech and what is done, tell him he has	
	
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do	
	
    My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated	
	
    My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;	
	
    My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul	
	
    My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys	
	
    My true betrothed love, and now my wife?	
	
    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt	
	
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times	
	
    My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,	
	
    My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.	
	
    My wretchedness unto a row of pins,	
	
    Myself had notice of your conventicles-	
	
    Myself in my incertain grounds to fail	
	
    Myself, my brother, and this grieved Count	
	
    Myself, well-mounted, hardly have escap'd.	
	
    Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:	
	
    Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;	
	
    Nay, but thou shalt stay too. I would my son	
	
    Nay, followed him till he had melted from	
	
    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.	
	
    Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What	
	
    Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,	
	
    Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day	
	
    Near to her close and consecrated bower,	
	
    Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful.	
	
    Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To	
	
    Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen.	
	
    Never like thee. O, let an old man embrace thee;	
	
    Never to be infected with delight,	
	
    Never to woo her more, but do forswear her,	
	
    Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds	
	
    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?	
	
    Next, if I be appointed for the place,	
	
    Nips youth i' th' head, and follies doth enew	
	
    No ceremony that to great ones longs,	
	
    No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt	
	
    No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed,	
	
    No honourable trust. I have done ill,	
	
    No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home;	
	
    No lesser of her honour confident	
	
    No love toward others in that bosom sits	
	
    No more my grief, in such a precious loss.	
	
    No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence	
	
    No more, I pray- and he's a steward.	
	
    No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.	
	
    No planet is of mine.	
	
    No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,	
	
    No touch of bashfulness? What! Will you tear	
	
    No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where	
	
    No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well	
	
    No, Lord Ambassador; I'll rather keep	
	
    No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves	
	
    No, my good lords, it is not that offends;	
	
    No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;	
	
    No, not to live. O nation miserable!	
	
    No, uncle, I'll none. Adam's sons are my brethren, and truly I	
	
    No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;	
	
    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye	
	
    None of my lord's ring! Why, he sent her none.	
	
    Nor Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,	
	
    Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,	
	
    Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand	
	
    Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,	
	
    Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;	
	
    Nor do I thee. Though I did wish him dead,	
	
    Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;	
	
    Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste;	
	
    Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.	
	
    Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish	
	
    Nor moody beggars, starving for a time	
	
    Nor never come in vizard to my friend,	
	
    Nor never look upon each other's face;	
	
    Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth	
	
    Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.	
	
    Nor sound his quillets shrilly. Hoar the flamen,	
	
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,	
	
    Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,	
	
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.	
	
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,	
	
    Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.	
	
    Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.        [A tucket sounds]	
	
    Norway himself, with terrible numbers,	
	
    Not a relation for a breakfast, nor	
	
    Not as deserv'd.	
	
    Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,	
	
    Not far, one Muliteus, my countryman-	
	
    Not having the power to do the good it would,	
	
    Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear;	
	
    Not lack your company.	
	
    Not one accompanying his declining foot.	
	
    Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft	
	
    Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear	
	
    Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me	
	
    Not that I have the power to clutch my hand	
	
    Not to be seen. My crown is call'd content;	
	
    Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!	
	
    Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.	
	
    Not what you are, I know it will excuse	
	
    Not yet thou know'st me, and, seeing me, dost not	
	
    Note notes, forsooth, and nothing!                  [Music.]	
	
    Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not.         Exit	
	
    Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.	
	
    Now I behold thy lively body so?	
	
    Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,	
	
    Now by this hand, I swear I scorn the term;	
	
    Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again-	
	
    Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.	
	
    Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,	
	
    Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;	
	
    Now have you heard the truth: what say you, Romans?	
	
    Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,	
	
    Now lays upon you.	
	
    Now like to whelps we crying run away.	
	
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead	
	
    Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.	
	
    Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea	
	
    Now thou art come unto a feast of death,	
	
    Now we are victors, upon us he smiles.	
	
    Now will I charge you in the band of truth,	
	
    Now will we take some order in the town,	
	
    Now, Lovell, from the Queen what is the news?	
	
    Now, afore God-God forbid I say true!-	
	
    Now, by the burning tapers of the sky	
	
    Now, for I know the Britaine Richmond aims	
	
    Now, if you can blush and cry guilty, Cardinal,	
	
    Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;	
	
    Now, this no more dishonours you at all	
	
    Nym; or else you had look'd through the grate, like a	
	
    O Caesar!                                     Sees the body.	
	
    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?	
	
    O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?	
	
    O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief	
	
    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman	
	
    O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!	
	
    O happy torment, when my torturer	
	
    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt	
	
    O insupportable and touching loss!	
	
    O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones.	
	
    O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought!	
	
    O my sweet master! O you memory	
	
    O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!	
	
    O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!	
	
    O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;	
	
    O that the living Harry had the temper	
	
    O tiger's heart wrapp'd in a woman's hide!	
	
    O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!	
	
    O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,	
	
    O! from Italy?	
	
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;	
	
    O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,	
	
    O'erstunk their feet.	
	
    O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine!	
	
    O, above measure false!	
	
    O, burn her, burn her! Hanging is too good.             Exit	
	
    O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!	
	
    O, had it been a stranger, not my child,	
	
    O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!	
	
    O, if to fight for king and commonweal	
	
    O, know you yet He doth it publicly.	
	
    O, let me make the period to my curse!	
	
    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.	
	
    O, not to-day, think not upon the fault	
	
    O, pardon me that I descend so low	
	
    O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,	
	
    O, step between her and her fighting soul	
	
    O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!	
	
    O, then how quickly should this arm of mine,	
	
    O, thou wilt be a wilderness again.	
	
    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!	
	
    O, what a world of vile ill-favour'd faults	
	
    O, would I were to die with Salisbury!	
	
    O- Desdemona-	
	
    Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember	
	
    Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims	
	
    Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,	
	
    Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male	
	
    Of France and England, did this king succeed;	
	
    Of Hotspur, Coldspur? that rebellion	
	
    Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?	
	
    Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.	
	
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal	
	
    Of all his people shall revolt from him,	
	
    Of all that I do know. Nor know I aught	
	
    Of all the world I lov'd, and to him put	
	
    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.	
	
    Of any prince so wild a libertine.	
	
    Of base and bloody insurrection	
	
    Of bold-fac'd victory. Then leaden age,	
	
    Of both your armies, whose equality	
	
    Of capital treason 'gainst the King and crown.	
	
    Of comely virtues;	
	
    Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns	
	
    Of double-fatal yew against thy state;	
	
    Of every creature's best!	
	
    Of excellent dumb discourse.	
	
    Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness	
	
    Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly	
	
    Of grave and austere quality, tender down	
	
    Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?	
	
    Of heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity.	
	
    Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought	
	
    Of him that caus'd it.	
	
    Of his profession, that his good receipt	
	
    Of his superior, grows to an envious fever	
	
    Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd	
	
    Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.        Exeunt	
	
    Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit,	
	
    Of man and country-	
	
    Of marching to Philippi presently?	
	
    Of mere compassion and of lenity,	
	
    Of my Lord General.	
	
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.	
	
    Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,	
	
    Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law.	
	
    Of one I danc'd withal.	
	
    Of one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn	
	
    Of our great action; therefore shall he die,	
	
    Of our two cousins' coming into London.	
	
    Of plain old form is much disfigured;	
	
    Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt	
	
    Of secret on her person, that he could not	
	
    Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,	
	
    Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,	
	
    Of such a winnowed purity in love.	
	
    Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain;	
	
    Of that insatiate Edward, noble York	
	
    Of the Duke's confessor, John de la Car,	
	
    Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,	
	
    Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points	
	
    Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,	
	
    Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one	
	
    Of their observant toil, the enemies' weight-	
	
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]	
	
    Of these thy compounds on such creatures as	
	
    Of this discourse we more will hear anon.	
	
    Of this proud king, who studies day and night	
	
    Of this young Percy's pride? The prisoners	
	
    Of threescore and two years- a silly time	
	
    Of thy intents desires instruction,	
	
    Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.	
	
    Of virtue for the name; but do not so.	
	
    Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw-	
	
    Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:	
	
    Of whom he's chief- with all the size that verity	
	
    Of woman in me. Now from head to foot	
	
    Of yonder knight?	
	
    Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,	
	
    Of your own cause.	
	
    Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate	
	
    Offending charity; if but a dozen French	
	
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,	
	
    Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,	
	
    Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice	
	
    On Navarre and his book-men, for here 'tis abused.	
	
    On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,	
	
    On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.	
	
    On him, his sons, his favourites, and his friends.	
	
    On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,	
	
    On most part of their fleet.	
	
    On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.	
	
    On that celestial harmony I go to.	
	
    On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?	
	
    On their departure most of all show evil;	
	
    On those that are, revenge: crimes, like lands,	
	
    On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,	
	
    On, Myrmidons, and cry you an amain	
	
    Once more let me behold it. Is it that	
	
    Once more, adieu; be valiant, and speed well!	
	
    One Hero died defil'd; but I do live,	
	
    One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,	
	
    One general tongue unto us, this good man,	
	
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.	
	
    One of our souls had wand'red in the air,	
	
    One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!	
	
    One that in all obedience makes the church	
	
    One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure,	
	
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!	
	
    Only a show or two, and so agree	
	
    Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.	
	
    Only reserv'd, you claim no interest	
	
    Open the door, or I will break it open.	
	
    Open, locks,	
	
    Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine;	
	
    Or God will punish me. I do believe,	
	
    Or I am much deceiv'd, of Portia.	
	
    Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;	
	
    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet	
	
    Or any groat I hoarded to my use,	
	
    Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,	
	
    Or being, concern you not.	
	
    Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?	
	
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,	
	
    Or by some other.	
	
    Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king.	
	
    Or do you almost think, although you see,	
	
    Or else I'll call my brother back again,	
	
    Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,	
	
    Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.	
	
    Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.	
	
    Or else you love not; for to be wise and love	
	
    Or fill up chronicles in time to come,	
	
    Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,	
	
    Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all	
	
    Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;	
	
    Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,	
	
    Or if he were not privy to those faults,	
	
    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,	
	
    Or in his eminence that fills it up,	
	
    Or it will seek me in another place,	
	
    Or let me die, to look on death no more!	
	
    Or live in peace abandon'd and despis'd!	
	
    Or manage it to part these men with me.	
	
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'	
	
    Or not remember what I must be now!	
	
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;	
	
    Or put upon you what restraint and grievance	
	
    Or sack this country with a mutiny.                   Exeunt	
	
    Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?	
	
    Or shall we sparingly show you far of	
	
    Or stand so mammering on. What? Michael Cassio,	
	
    Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,	
	
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd	
	
    Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,	
	
    Or to the meanest groom.	
	
    Or unto death, to do my country good.	
	
    Or we are Romans and will give you that,	
	
    Or whether 'twas report of her success,	
	
    Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height	
	
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,	
	
    Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,	
	
    Or, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,	
	
    Or, if you'd ask, remember this before:	
	
    Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.	
	
    Or, with an outstretch'd throat, I'll tell the world aloud	
	
    Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;	
	
    Otherwise I renounce all confidence.

    So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,	
	
    So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle	
	
    So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,	
	
    So fare you well till we shall meet again.	
	
    So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,

    So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:	
	
    So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,	
	
    So much as frown on you?	
	
    So much for that. The silent hours steal on,	
	
    So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,

    Some beast rear'd this; here does not live a man.	
	
    Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.	
	
    Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to	
	
    Some few odd lads that you remember not.	
	
    Some guard these traitors to the block of death,	
	
    Some misadventure.	
	
    Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;	
	
    Some of us would lie low.	
	
    Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,	
	
    Some speedy messenger bid her repair	
	
    Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds;	
	
    Some touches of remorse, or is your blood	
	
    Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,	
	
    Something I must do to procure me grace.	
	
    Something not worth in me such rich beholding	
	
    Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence!-	
	
    Son to the Queen, after his own report;	
	
    Sons of Henry IV	
	
    Sophy.	
	
    Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;	
	
    Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;	
	
    Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:	
	
    Speak it again, and even with the word	
	
    Speak that which is not.	
	
    Speak to her, Hamlet.	
	
    Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?	
	
    Speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.	
	
    Speaks his own standing! What a mental power	
	
    Spirits	
	
    Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.	
	
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,	
	
    Spurr'd, gall'd, and tir'd, by jauncing Bolingbroke.	
	
    Stafford, take her to thee.	
	
    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?	
	
    Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag,	
	
    Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the King	
	
    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.	
	
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.	
	
    Stanley, I prithee go, and take me hence;	
	
    Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity	
	
    Stay, the King hath thrown his warder down.	
	
    Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;	
	
    Steps me a little higher than his vow	
	
    Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst	
	
    Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?	
	
    Still met the King, lov'd him next heav'n, obey'd him,	
	
    Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:	
	
    Stood here observing him. Some strange commotion	
	
    Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any	
	
    Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;	
	
    Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd;	
	
    Strangers in court do take her for the Queen.	
	
    Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them	
	
    Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.          Exeunt	
	
    Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.	
	
    Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,	
	
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,	
	
    Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend	
	
    Success and conquest to attend on us.	
	
    Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard	
	
    Such as befits the pleasure of the court?	
	
    Such as he is, full of regard and honor.	
	
    Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain	
	
    Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes	
	
    Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,	
	
    Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,	
	
    Such separation as may well be said	
	
    Such violent hands upon her tender life.	
	
    Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule	
	
    Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,	
	
    Supplied with worthy men! plant love among's!	
	
    Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money	
	
    Surely, by all the glory you have won,	
	
    Suspect me that I mean no good to him.	
	
    Swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither-I escap'd	
	
    Swear.	
	
    Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook	
	
    Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.	
	
    Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty,	
	
    Swooning destruction; or some joy too fine,	
	
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps	
	
    T' extol what it hath done.	
	
    THREE STRANGERS	
	
    Ta'en off by poison.	
	
    Take from my mouth the wish of happy years.	
	
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.	
	
    Take hold on me; for my particular grief	
	
    Take not away the taper, leave it burning;	
	
    Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,	
	
    Take this along; I writ it for thy sake     [Gives a letter]	
	
    Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.	
	
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this	
	
    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,	
	
    Takes on the point of honour to support	
	
    Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor.	
	
    Tarry you a little-a-while.                        [Writes]	
	
    Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,	
	
    Teach us some fence!  [To AUSTRIA]  Sirrah, were I at home,	
	
    Tell her I have chastis'd the amorous Troyan,	
	
    Tell her I hold as giddily as Fortune;	
	
    Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance;	
	
    Tell him, so please him come unto this place,	
	
    Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,	
	
    Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?	
	
    Tell them that God bids us do good for evil.	
	
    Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?	
	
    Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons	
	
    Ten years are spent since first he undertook	
	
    Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,	
	
    Th' advantage of the time prompts me aloud	
	
    Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy	
	
    Th' have not prepar'd for us.	
	
    Th' insatiate greediness of his desire,	
	
    Th' uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;	
	
    Th'imperial Caesar, Caesar, should again unite	
	
    Than Edward will for tidings of my death.	
	
    Than I myself, poor man.	
	
    Than I will wrong such honorable men.	
	
    Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!	
	
    Than answer my waked wrath!	
	
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.	
	
    Than bring a burden of dishonour home	
	
    Than could his war resisted.	
	
    Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus	
	
    Than drink so much in one.	
	
    Than feed on cates and have him talk to me	
	
    Than from it issued forced drops of blood;	
	
    Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?	
	
    Than if the Earl were here; for men must think,	
	
    Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than himself	
	
    Than is the coal of fire upon the ice	
	
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love	
	
    Than music from the spheres.	
	
    Than one that's sick o' th' gout, since he had rather	
	
    Than pard or cat o' mountain.	
	
    Than stamps in gold, or sums in sealed bags;	
	
    Than such a murther is.	
	
    Than that which is to approach.	
	
    Than the constraint of hospitable zeal	
	
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.	
	
    Than this is all as true as it is strange;	
	
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.	
	
    Than to abhor himself; even he drops down	
	
    Than to be perk'd up in a glist'ring grief	
	
    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,	
	
    Than what he chooses.	
	
    Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting	
	
    Than where castles mounted stand.	
	
    Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.	
	
    Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon;	
	
    Thanks, courteous wall. Jove shield thee well for this!	
	
    That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange?	
	
    That Caesar and his Senate must redress?	
	
    That Christendom gives out.	
	
    That Douglas and the English rebels met	
	
    That Henry born at Monmouth should win all,	
	
    That I advise your shunning.	
	
    That I am that same wall; the truth is so;	
	
    That I crave death more willingly than mercy;	
	
    That I disdain; but for these other gawds,	
	
    That I essentially am not in madness,	
	
    That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.	
	
    That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?	
	
    That I kiss aught but he.	
	
    That I may see again.	
	
    That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!	
	
    That I might rail at him to ease my mind!	
	
    That I must yield my body to the earth	
	
    That I shall blush in acting, and might well	
	
    That I was cast. And even but now he spake	
	
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,	
	
    That I yet know not?	
	
    That Lepidus of the triumvirate	
	
    That Marcius shall be consul.	
	
    That Richard be restored to his blood.	
	
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?	
	
    That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;	
	
    That all the court admir'd him for submission.	
	
    That all the miseries which nature owes	
	
    That an invisible instinct should frame them	
	
    That any one should therefore be suspicious	
	
    That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly,	
	
    That are your prisoners-	
	
    That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow	
	
    That bears the name of life? Yet in this life	
	
    That best can aid your action.	
	
    That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow.	
	
    That box I gave you was not thought by me	
	
    That brings me food to make misfortune live?	
	
    That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.	
	
    That came too lag to see him buried.	
	
    That cannot brook the accent of reproof.	
	
    That cannot so much as a blossom yield	
	
    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,	
	
    That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,	
	
    That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart-	
	
    That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,	
	
    That death in me at others' lives may laugh.	
	
    That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her	
	
    That dips in the same dish? For, in my knowing,	
	
    That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?	
	
    That doth accuse his master of high treason;	
	
    That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.	
	
    That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather	
	
    That e'er did lift up eye.	
	
    That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,	
	
    That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,	
	
    That ever grac'd me with thy company?	
	
    That ever love did make thee run into,	
	
    That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.	
	
    That every tongue says beauty should look so.	
	
    That fame may cry you aloud. I say farewell.	
	
    That feel the bruises of the days before,	
	
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame	
	
    That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.	
	
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole	
	
    That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,	
	
    That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,	
	
    That goddess blind,	
	
    That greatness should so grossly offer it.	
	
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature	
	
    That had not half a week to go, like rams	
	
    That has a name. But there's no bottom, none,	
	
    That hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness	
	
    That hath express'd himself in all his deeds	
	
    That haunted us in our familiar paths.	
	
    That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,	
	
    That he believes himself; so do not I.	
	
    That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,	
	
    That he his high authority abus'd,	
	
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;	
	
    That he misconstrues all that you have done.	
	
    That he spake to thee?	
	
    That he would labour my delivery.	
	
    That he's undrown'd.	
	
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!	
	
    That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.       [Floulish]	
	
    That his soul sicken not.	
	
    That hour destroy us?	
	
    That if your Highness should intend to sleep	
	
    That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose	
	
    That in the field lie slain; of princes in this number,	
	
    That in this spleen ridiculous appears,	
	
    That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.	
	
    That is not glad to see thee! You are three	
	
    That is the word. I thee defy again.	
	
    That is, to live and study here three years.	
	
    That it becomes a virtue.	
	
    That it might go on wheels!	
	
    That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.	
	
    That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.	
	
    That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.	
	
    That labouring art can never ransom nature	
	
    That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.	
	
    That lie too heavy on the commonwealth;	
	
    That like a jewel has hung twenty years	
	
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-	
	
    That look'd upon't.	
	
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,	
	
    That makes calamity of so long life.	
	
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?	
	
    That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?	
	
    That many things, having full reference	
	
    That may repeat and history his los	
	
    That men shall swear I have discontinued school	
	
    That might have known my place. I see no sense for't,	
	
    That most ingrateful boy there by your side	
	
    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief	
	
    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes	
	
    That neither, singly, can be manifested	
	
    That never set a squadron in the field,	
	
    That no man shall have private conference,	
	
    That none so small advantage shall step forth	
	
    That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,	
	
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them	
	
    That of his bounties taste! The five best Senses	
	
    That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,	
	
    That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants-	
	
    That owes two buckets, filling one another;	
	
    That policy may either last so long,	
	
    That presses them and learns them first to bear,	
	
    That pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow,	
	
    That rheumatic diseases do abound.	
	
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,	
	
    That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub	
	
    That see I by our faces. We are fellows still,	
	
    That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death	
	
    That shall attend his love.	
	
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.	
	
    That shapes this monstrous apparition.	
	
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;	
	
    That she whom all men prais'd, and whom myself,	
	
    That should consume it, I have not the face	
	
    That show of such an exercise may colour	
	
    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.	
	
    That so he might recover what was lost.	
	
    That sold'rest close impossibilities,	
	
    That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,	
	
    That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,	
	
    That stay at home, if bearing carry it;	
	
    That strew the green lap of the new come spring?	
	
    That such an army could be drawn in France,	
	
    That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?	
	
    That take it on you at the first so roundly.	
	
    That tempers him to this extremity.	
	
    That the first face of neither, on the start,	
	
    That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,	
	
    That the proportion both of thanks and payment	
	
    That their good souls may be appeas'd with slaughter	
	
    That these great lords, and Margaret our Queen,	
	
    That they devour their reason, and scarce think	
	
    That they have overborne their continents.	
	
    That they which brought me in my master's hate,	
	
    That things ill got had ever bad success?	
	
    That this my mother's son was none of his;	
	
    That thou adorest and hast in reverence-	
	
    That thou art so inhuman- 'twill not prove so.	
	
    That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,	
	
    That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.	
	
    That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress	
	
    That thought her like her seeming. It had been vicious	
	
    That through the window bars bore at men's eyes	
	
    That thus you should proceed to put me of	
	
    That to my foes this body must be prey,	
	
    That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?	
	
    That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,	
	
    That violates the smallest branch herein.	
	
    That war, or peace, or both at once, may be	
	
    That warranteth by law to be thy privilege:	
	
    That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France	
	
    That we for thee may glorify the Lord.	
	
    That we have given him cause.	
	
    That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.	
	
    That we should dress us fairly for our end.	
	
    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose	
	
    That were excusable, that and thousands more	
	
    That were with him exil'd. This to be true	
	
    That what we have we prize not to the worth	
	
    That which I owe is lost; but if you please	
	
    That which t' appear itself must not yet be	
	
    That will betime, and may by us be fitted.	
	
    That will speak anything?	
	
    That winter lion, who in rage forgets	
	
    That with this little arm and this good sword	
	
    That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me,	
	
    That would deliver up his greatness so	
	
    That wrought upon thee so preposterously	
	
    That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think	
	
    That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not	
	
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,	
	
    That you have slander'd so?	
	
    That you know well. Something it is I would-	
	
    That you shall stifle in your own report,	
	
    That you will clear yourself from all suspense.	
	
    That you would love yourself, and in that love	
	
    That your activity may defeat and quell	
	
    That's curdied by the frost from purest snow,	
	
    That's the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,	
	
    That's yet unbruis'd; bring me but out at gate.	
	
    That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,	
	
    That, had he Duncan's sons under his key-	
	
    That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious.	
	
    That, like a lion fostered up at hand,	
	
    That, through the sight I bear in things to come,	
	
    That, were I ta'en here, it would scarce be answer'd.	
	
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!	
	
    The Archbishop's Grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer	
	
    The Britons have raz'd out, though with the loss	
	
    The Cardinal's malice and his potency	
	
    The Dauphin rages at our very heels.	
	
    The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish	
	
    The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims	
	
    The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,	
	
    The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,	
	
    The French King's sister. Heaven will one day open	
	
    The Grecian youths are full of quality;	
	
    The King and his companions; warily	
	
    The King from Eltham I intend to steal,	
	
    The King is now in progress towards Saint Albans,	
	
    The King mine uncle is to blame for it.	
	
    The King that lov'd him, as the state stood then,	
	
    The King's attorney, on the contrary,	
	
    The King's physician; as he pass'd along,	
	
    The Man i' th' Moon's too slow, till newborn chins	
	
    The Prince and Claudio promis'd by this hour	
	
    The Prince's espials have informed me	
	
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.	
	
    The Queen is comfortless, and we forgetful	
	
    The Senate hath sent about three several quests	
	
    The Volsces are in arms.	
	
    The action of their bodies from their souls;	
	
    The agent of thy foul inconstancy-	
	
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.	
	
    The armourers accomplishing the knights,	
	
    The azur'd hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor	
	
    The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,	
	
    The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;	
	
    The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.	
	
    The best-regarded virgins of our clime	
	
    The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest	
	
    The blind and bloody with foul hand	
	
    The blood of malice in a vein of league,	
	
    The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolv'd, and loos'd;	
	
    The bragging Spaniard.	
	
    The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,	
	
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,	
	
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,	
	
    The cause of his arrival here in arms;	
	
    The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,	
	
    The chief perfections of that lovely dame,	
	
    The civil citizens kneading up the honey,	
	
    The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me	
	
    The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,	
	
    The common voice, I see, is verified	
	
    The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,	
	
    The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd	
	
    The country cocks do crow, the clocks do ton,	
	
    The crown o' th' earth doth melt. My lord!	
	
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.	
	
    The danger to itself?	
	
    The dangers of the time. You swore to us,	
	
    The day, my friends, and all things, stay for me.     Exeunt	
	
    The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,	
	
    The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much	
	
    The discontents repair, and men's reports	
	
    The door is open, sir; there lies your way;	
	
    The dukedom, yet unbow'd-alas, poor Milan!-	
	
    The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.	
	
    The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.	
	
    The enemy flying.	
	
    The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome	
	
    The execution of my big-swol'n heart	
	
    The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.             Exit	
	
    The fatal balls of murdering basilisks;	
	
    The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,	
	
    The fellow has a deal of that too much	
	
    The fineness of which metal is not found	
	
    The first-begotten and the lawful heir	
	
    The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry;	
	
    The fold stands empty in the drowned field,	
	
    The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen	
	
    The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy	
	
    The frame and huge foundation of the earth	
	
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.	
	
    The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads	
	
    The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me	
	
    The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.           Exeunt	
	
    The gods will diet me with. Prithee away!	
	
    The good gods will mock me presently	
	
    The gravity and stillness of your youth	
	
    The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen	
	
    The greatness of his person.	
	
    The hands of Romans!	
	
    The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.	
	
    The head is not more native to the heart,	
	
    The heart that conn'd them.	
	
    The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.	
	
    The help of mine own eyes.	
	
    The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,	
	
    The hope and expectation of thy time	
	
    The horned herd! For I have savage cause,	
	
    The image of his power lay then in me;	
	
    The imperious churchman; Somerset, Buckingham,	
	
    The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood	
	
    The ivy which had hid my princely trunk	
	
    The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't,	
	
    The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,	
	
    The ladies did change favours; and then we,	
	
    The language I have learnt these forty years,	
	
    The last was I that felt thy tyranny.	
	
    The leading of thine own revenges, take	
	
    The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,	
	
    The lethargy must have his quiet course.	
	
    The like allayment could I give my grief.	
	
    The lion, mov'd with pity, did endure	
	
    The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!	
	
    The loyalty well held to fools does make	
	
    The lunatic, the lover, and the poet,	
	
    The man is noble, and his fame folds in	
	
    The manner of his speech; for't cannot be	
	
    The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,	
	
    The matter's in my head and in my heart;	
	
    The meat was well, if you were so contented.	
	
    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,	
	
    The mind I sway by and the heart I bear	
	
    The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,	
	
    The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;	
	
    The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.	
	
    The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion	
	
    The mouths, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men	
	
    The name of Prosper; it did bass my trespass.	
	
    The nature of our seats, and make the rabble	
	
    The nature of their crimes, that I may minister	
	
    The next degree is England's royal throne,	
	
    The noble Duke of Bedford, late deceas'd,	
	
    The noble Thanes do bravely in the war,	
	
    The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?	
	
    The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!	
	
    The offer likes not; and the nimble gunner	
	
    The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.	
	
    The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,	
	
    The other four in wondrous motion.	
	
    The other part reserv'd I by consent,	
	
    The other, that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!	
	
    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.	
	
    The parcels and particulars of our grief,	
	
    The past-proportion of his infinite,	
	
    The peace between the French and us not values	
	
    The people liberal valiant, active, wealthy;	
	
    The pitfall nor the gin.	
	
    The pleasure that some fathers feed upon	
	
    The pow'rs, delaying, not forgetting, have	
	
    The practice of it lives in John the bastard,	
	
    The prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies	
	
    The pretty-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,	
	
    The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;	
	
    The purple sap from her sweet brother's body,	
	
    The qualities of people. Come, my queen;	
	
    The queen of earthly queens. She's noble born;	
	
    The rather for I earnestly beseech,	
	
    The reasons are more potent and heroical.	
	
    The rest I'd give to be to you translated.	
	
    The rest do nothing- with this word 'Stand, stand!'	
	
    The rich advantage of good exercise?	
	
    The rites for which I love him are bereft me,	
	
    The royal banner, and all quality,	
	
    The same you are not, which for your best ends	
	
    The sea enraged is not half so deaf,	
	
    The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,	
	
    The secrets of my heart.	
	
    The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim	
	
    The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep	
	
    The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva,	
	
    The silver livery of advised age,	
	
    The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;	
	
    The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!	
	
    The smallest scruple of her excellence	
	
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war	
	
    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,	
	
    The special watchmen of our English weal,	
	
    The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands	
	
    The steps of wrong-should move you to mew up	
	
    The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?	
	
    The stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs?	
	
    The sudden breach on't.	
	
    The sums I have collected shall express.	
	
    The sun will set before I shall discharge	
	
    The swelling difference of your settled hate;	
	
    The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?	
	
    The tenure of my book; trust not my age,	
	
    The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,	
	
    The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this:	
	
    The thwartings of your dispositions, if	
	
    The time is unagreeable to this business.	
	
    The tongues o' th' common mouth. I do despise them,	
	
    The trap is laid for me!	
	
    The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people	
	
    The trumpets sound. Stand close, the Queen is coming.	
	
    The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,	
	
    The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated	
	
    The unyok'd humour of your idleness.	
	
    The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,	
	
    The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,	
	
    The very firstlings of my heart shall be	
	
    The very mercy of the law cries out	
	
    The villain is alive in Titus' house,	
	
    The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,	
	
    The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,	
	
    The water of my land, find her disease	
	
    The way twice o'er.	
	
    The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine's churchyard,	
	
    The which if he can prove, 'a pops me out	
	
    The which will I-not all so much for love	
	
    The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,	
	
    The will of heaven be done, and the King's pleasure	
	
    The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many	
	
    The words would add more anguish than the wounds.	
	
    The world is still deceiv'd with ornament.	
	
    The worst is this, that at so slender warning	
	
    The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,	
	
    The yearly course that brings this day about	
	
    Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,	
	
    Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,	
	
    Their clothes are after such a pagan cut to't,	
	
    Their eyes do offices of truth, their words	
	
    Their hands and faces were all badged with blood;	
	
    Their mercy at the price of one fair word,	
	
    Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,	
	
    Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.	
	
    Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,	
	
    Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!	
	
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,	
	
    Then 'tis but reason that I be releas'd	
	
    Then all afire with me; the King's son, Ferdinand,	
	
    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.	
	
    Then curs'd she Hastings. O, remember, God,	
	
    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)	
	
    Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.         Exit	
	
    Then howsome'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things	
	
    Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.	
	
    Then lay me forth; although unqueen'd, yet like	
	
    Then let them use us well; else let them know,	
	
    Then let us take a ceremonious leave	
	
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,	
	
    Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave-	
	
    Then take my soul-my body, soul, and all,	
	
    Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,	
	
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,	
	
    Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,	
	
    Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,	
	
    Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.	
	
    Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;	
	
    Then, for the third part of a minute, hence:	
	
    Then, if thou grant'st th'art a man, I have forgot thee.	
	
    Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,	
	
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,	
	
    There cannot be those numberless offences	
	
    There hangs a vaporous drop profound;	
	
    There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.	
	
    There is a mystery-with whom relation	
	
    There is a soul counts thee her creditor,	
	
    There is indeed; which they would have your Grace	
	
    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,	
	
    There is no stir or walking in the streets,	
	
    There is no wrong, but every thing is right.	
	
    There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet	
	
    There lies thy part.                [Strikes her. She falls]	
	
    There my Lysander and myself shall meet;	
	
    There shall we consummate our spousal rites.	
	
    There shalt thou find the mariners asleep	
	
    There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.	
	
    There to give up their pow'r. If you can, pace your wisdom	
	
    There was a yielding- this admits no excuse.	
	
    There will we make our peds of roses,	
	
    There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,	
	
    There's another.	
	
    There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;	
	
    There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!	
	
    There's none Protector of the realm but I.	
	
    There's not a soldier of us all that, in the thanksgiving before	
	
    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight	
	
    There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.	
	
    There, my lord.	
	
    There, where we see the lights.	
	
    Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.	
	
    Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,	
	
    Therefore devise with me how we may fly,	
	
    Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,	
	
    Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,	
	
    Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,	
	
    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.	
	
    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.	
	
    Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his	
	
    Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,	
	
    Therefore, go speak- the Duke will hear thy voice;	
	
    Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,	
	
    Therein illustrated; the honour of it	
	
    Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.	
	
    These are a side that would be glad to have	
	
    These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.	
	
    These eyes that see thee now well coloured	
	
    These from our King unto your Majesty.	
	
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,	
	
    These miseries are more than may be borne.	
	
    These pipes and these conveyances of our blood	
	
    These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies;	
	
    These tidings nip me, and I hang the head	
	
    These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart.	
	
    They are a sweet society of fair ones.	
	
    They are in readiness.	
	
    They are rising, they are rising.	
	
    They are too thin and bare to hide offences.	
	
    They cast their caps up and carouse together	
	
    They did not bless us with one happy word.	
	
    They fall their crests and like deceitful jades	
	
    They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,	
	
    They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em	
	
    They have plac'd their men of trust?	
	
    They know their master loves to be aloft,	
	
    They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war	
	
    They never do beget a coal-black calf.	
	
    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,	
	
    They say, is shamefully bereft of life.	
	
    They set him free without his ransom paid,	
	
    They shall not live within this world, I swear,	
	
    They swell and grow as terrible as storms.	
	
    They think they are mine; and though train'd up thus meanly	
	
    They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,	
	
    They would not mark me; if they did mark,	
	
    They'll give him death by inches.	
	
    They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know	
	
    Thieves! Thieves!	
	
    Things done undone; but if he be at hand,	
	
    Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'	
	
    Think not, although in writing I preferr'd	
	
    Think thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue	
	
    Think upon what hath chanced, and at more time,	
	
    Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man	
	
    This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood;	
	
    This I do vow and this shall ever be,	
	
    This ague fit of fear is over-blown;	
	
    This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,	
	
    This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;	
	
    This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.	
	
    This child of fancy, that Armado hight,	
	
    This dastard, at the battle of Patay,	
	
    This day had plotted, in the council-house,	
	
    This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!	
	
    This devil here shall be my substitute;	
	
    This evening on the east side of the grove.	
	
    This fair alliance quickly shall can home	
	
    This from a dying man receive as certain:	
	
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,	
	
    This happy child did I get anything.	
	
    This harness'd masque and unadvised revel	
	
    This inundation of mistemp'red humour	
	
    This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, withered,	
	
    This is an accident of hourly proof,	
	
    This is my fault. As for the rest appeal'd,	
	
    This is she-	
	
    This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,	
	
    This is the door.	
	
    This is the latest glory of thy praise	
	
    This is the way to kindle, not to quench.	
	
    This isle with Calibans.	
	
    This lady's husband here, this, do you see?-	
	
    This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show	
	
    This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child.	
	
    This minion stood upon her chastity,	
	
    This morning, like the spirit of a youth	
	
    This mutiny were better put in hazard	
	
    This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,	
	
    This other Eden, demi-paradise,	
	
    This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and	
	
    This precious stone set in the silver sea,	
	
    This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!	
	
    This rock and these demesnes have been my world,	
	
    This seeming brow of justice, did he win	
	
    This ship-boy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite.	
	
    This siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine,	
	
    This sudden sending him away must seem	
	
    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,	
	
    This to my cousin Scroop; and all the rest	
	
    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.	
	
    This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?	
	
    This warlike volley.	
	
    This way fall I to death.	
	
    This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.	
	
    This wooden slavery than to suffer	
	
    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;	
	
    Thither we bend again.	
	
    Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.	
	
    Those in commission yet return'd?	
	
    Those that we bury back, our monuments	
	
    Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;	
	
    Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight	
	
    Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come	
	
    Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother	
	
    Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;	
	
    Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.	
	
    Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice-	
	
    Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!	
	
    Thou cam'st-	
	
    Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome-	
	
    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on	
	
    Thou disease of a friend and not himself!	
	
    Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart.	
	
    Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!	
	
    Thou foul accursed minister of hell!	
	
    Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him.	
	
    Thou hast a better place in his affection	
	
    Thou hast harp'd my fear aright. But one word more-	
	
    Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,	
	
    Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.	
	
    Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.	
	
    Thou know'st not me.	
	
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright	
	
    Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,	
	
    Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.	
	
    Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond	
	
    Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.	
	
    Thou rather, with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,	
	
    Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left	
	
    Thou shalt aby it.	
	
    Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths.	
	
    Thou should'st desire to die, being miserable.	
	
    Thou show'st a noble vessel. What's thy name?	
	
    Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.	
	
    Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come.	
	
    Thou this to hazard needs must intimate	
	
    Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.	
	
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;	
	
    Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not	
	
    Thou'st made me cuckold.	
	
    Though Bassianus be the Emperor's brother,	
	
    Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;	
	
    Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults	
	
    Though all the world's vastidity you had,	
	
    Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge-	
	
    Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;	
	
    Though in some part enforced to digress,	
	
    Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.	
	
    Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake;	
	
    Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,	
	
    Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood-	
	
    Though they be never so ridiculous,	
	
    Though tongues were out of use.	
	
    Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,	
	
    Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.	
	
    Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?	
	
    Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais	
	
    Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,	
	
    Thrice-fam'd beyond, beyond all erudition;	
	
    Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.	
	
    Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,	
	
    Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.	
	
    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground	
	
    Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,	
	
    Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,	
	
    Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men	
	
    Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,	
	
    Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,	
	
    Thus stands the case: you know our King, my brother,	
	
    Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world	
	
    Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say amen,	
	
    Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,	
	
    Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.	
	
    Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,	
	
    Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural	
	
    Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,	
	
    Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy,	
	
    Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,	
	
    Thy hand hath murd'red him. I had a mighty cause	
	
    Thy honorable mettle may be wrought	
	
    Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,	
	
    Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance	
	
    Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say	
	
    Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down	
	
    Thy mother took into her blameful bed	
	
    Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.	
	
    Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;	
	
    Thy rankest fault-all of them; and require	
	
    Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;	
	
    Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?	
	
    Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit,	
	
    Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe	
	
    Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,	
	
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;	
	
    Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands.	
	
    Till Henry be more weak and I more strong.-	
	
    Till I be crown'd, and that my sword be stain'd	
	
    Till Saturninus be Rome's Emperor.	
	
    Till all the Andronici be made away.	
	
    Till he communicate his parts to others;	
	
    Till he did look on me; since it is so,	
	
    Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn	
	
    Till now infixed I beheld myself	
	
    Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.	
	
    Till that the nature of your fault be known	
	
    Till then I banish thee, on pain of death,	
	
    Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,	
	
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;	
	
    Till time lend friends, and friends their helpful swords.	
	
    Till we meet Warwick with his foreign pow'r.          Exeunt	
	
    Till you know better how to handle it.	
	
    Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.	
	
    To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.	
	
    To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!               Exit	
	
    To Fortune's alms.	
	
    To Henry's body, and supply his place;	
	
    To Lucio] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,	
	
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,	
	
    To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,	
	
    To a determin'd scope.	
	
    To add the death of you.	
	
    To alter favor ever is to fear.	
	
    To angle for your thoughts; but you are wise-	
	
    To answer mildly; for they are prepar'd	
	
    To any tongue, speak it of what it will.	
	
    To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.	
	
    To base declension and loath'd bigamy.	
	
    To be a party in this injury.	
	
    To be asham'd to be my father's child!	
	
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,	
	
    To be discover'd, that can do me good?	
	
    To be in anger is impiety;	
	
    To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.	
	
    To be received plain, I'll speak more gross-	
	
    To be spoke to but by the Recorder.	
	
    To be the father unto many sons.	
	
    To be thy lord and master. Seek the King;	
	
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom	
	
    To bear with their perverse objections,	
	
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.	
	
    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath	
	
    To brave the Tribune in his brother's hearing.	
	
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,	
	
    To bring it into danger.	
	
    To build at all? Much more, in this great work-	
	
    To burn the lodging where you use to lie,	
	
    To buy you a better husband.	
	
    To call me to your Senate, I'll deliver	
	
    To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep	
	
    To changes two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.	
	
    To chide my fortune, and torment myself?	
	
    To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,	
	
    To come alone, either he so undertaking	
	
    To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,	
	
    To cope malicious censurers, which ever	
	
    To crop at once a too long withered flower.	
	
    To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:	
	
    To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.	
	
    To dash our late decree in parliament	
	
    To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.	
	
    To diet rank minds sick of happiness,	
	
    To do a great right do a little wrong,	
	
    To do no contrived murther. I lack iniquity	
	
    To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,	
	
    To dote thus on such luggage? Let 't alone,	
	
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather	
	
    To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee.	
	
    To ease your country of distressful war,	
	
    To enter human hearing, from Argier	
	
    To entertain great England's lawful king.	
	
    To entreat your Majesty to visit him.	
	
    To execute the noble Duke at Calais.	
	
    To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.	
	
    To feast and sport us at thy father's house.	
	
    To feed contention in a ling'ring act;	
	
    To fight against me under Percy's pay,	
	
    To find out right with wrong-it may not be;	
	
    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?	
	
    To force a spotless virgin's chastity,	
	
    To fright the animals, and to kill them up	
	
    To furnish me with some swift means of death	
	
    To gain the love o' th' commonalty; the Duke	
	
    To give full growth to that which still doth grow.	
	
    To give it due content.	
	
    To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd	
	
    To give the enemy way, and to secure us	
	
    To give up willingly that noble title	
	
    To go to Paris?	
	
    To grace the gentry of a land remote	
	
    To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.	
	
    To half a soul and to a notion crazed	
	
    To have begg'd or bought what I have took. Good troth,	
	
    To have her love, provided that your fortune	
	
    To have me fold up Parca's fatal web?	
	
    To have my praise for this, perform a part	
	
    To have them fall no more. You some permit	
	
    To hear and see the matter.	
	
    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!	
	
    To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,	
	
    To hear themselves rememb'red.	
	
    To help unarm our Hector. His stubborn buckles,	
	
    To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,	
	
    To him or our authorities. For an end,	
	
    To him that does best. God forbid else. Cardinal,	
	
    To him, I say.	
	
    To his grand sea.	
	
    To hold your honour more precise and nice	
	
    To honour me as thy king and sovereign,	
	
    To instruct her fully in those sciences,	
	
    To join with men in scorning your poor friend?	
	
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed	
	
    To keep our great Saint George's feast withal.	
	
    To keep your great pretences veil'd till when	
	
    To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?	
	
    To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.	
	
    To know what willing ransom he will give.	
	
    To lay a heavy and unequal hand	
	
    To leave me but a little to myself.	
	
    To leave that latest which concerns him first,	
	
    To let me be partaker.	
	
    To let you enter his unpeopled house.	
	
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.	
	
    To live and burn in everlasting fire,	
	
    To look with forehead bold and big enough	
	
    To love her for her mother's sake, that lov'd him,	
	
    To make a more requital to your love!	
	
    To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.	
	
    To make great haste. All fast? What means this? Ho!	
	
    To make it clear, but do confess I have	
	
    To make my heart her vassal.	
	
    To make the fox surveyor of the fold?	
	
    To make their audit at your Highness' pleasure,	
	
    To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this	
	
    To make yourself a son out of my blood.	
	
    To match with her that brings no vantages.	
	
    To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,	
	
    To meet displeasure farther from the doors	
	
    To melt the city leads upon your pates,	
	
    To mitigate the justice of thy plea,	
	
    To murther, murther our solemnity?	
	
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour	
	
    To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell	
	
    To offer service to your enemy;	
	
    To one whom they had punish'd.	
	
    To our fast-closed gates; for at this match	
	
    To our solemnity. I trust we shall,	
	
    To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,	
	
    To part so slightly with your wife's first gift,	
	
    To pity too.	
	
    To pluck away their power; as now at last	
	
    To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd moon,	
	
    To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.	
	
    To prison with her. And away with him.	
	
    To prove it on thee to the extremest point	
	
    To public ear;	
	
    To put him quite besides his patience.	
	
    To question of his apprehension.	
	
    To ransom my two nephews from their death;	
	
    To reconcile you all unto the King.                   Exeunt	
	
    To revel it with him and his new bride.	
	
    To rob me of so rich a bottom here.	
	
    To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;	
	
    To saucy doubts and fears -But Banquo's safe?	
	
    To say 'Live, boy.' Ne'er thank thy master. Live;	
	
    To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;	
	
    To scarlet indignation, and bedew	
	
    To see great Hercules whipping a gig,	
	
    To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!	
	
    To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.          Exeunt	
	
    To see th' enclosed lights, now canopied	
	
    To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.	
	
    To see your Grace.	
	
    To seel her father's eyes up close as oak-	
	
    To send them to you only for this night;	
	
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't	
	
    To set the exact wealth of all our states	
	
    To shape my legs of an unequal size;	
	
    To show his teeth as white as whales-bone;	
	
    To show the letter that I writ to you.	
	
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her	
	
    To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?	
	
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!	
	
    To some more fitter place, and that with speed.	
	
    To sour your happiness I must report	
	
    To speak with Coriolanus.	
	
    To spend the time to end it.	
	
    To square for this? Would it offend you, then,	
	
    To start my quiet.	
	
    To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.	
	
    To stride a limit.	
	
    To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too;	
	
    To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,	
	
    To suffer all alike. That he should dream,	
	
    To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride	
	
    To take me to thee, as I was to him	
	
    To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we	
	
    To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,	
	
    To tell them that this world did equal theirs	
	
    To tender it herself. I undertook it,	
	
    To th' end of reck'ning.	
	
    To th' hopeful execution do I leave you	
	
    To th' way she's forc'd to.	
	
    To the King's danger. Presently the Duke	
	
    To the ambassadors of England gives	
	
    To the direction just.	
	
    To the hot passion of distemp'red blood	
	
    To the possession of thy royal hand.	
	
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:	
	
    To thee I pray: sweet Clifford, pity me.	
	
    To them accordingly.	
	
    To these two princes, if you marry them.	
	
    To think our former state a happy dream;	
	
    To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood	
	
    To this last costly treaty, th' interview	
	
    To those have shut him up; which failing,	
	
    To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;	
	
    To thy fair way!	
	
    To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.	
	
    To treat of high affairs touching that time.	
	
    To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists	
	
    To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus	
	
    To understand a law; to know the meaning	
	
    To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr'd, it follows	
	
    To velvet guards and Sunday citizens. Come, sing.	
	
    To visit her poor castle where she lies,	
	
    To wail the dimming of our shining star;	
	
    To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!	
	
    To wear an undeserved dignity.	
	
    To weep is to make less the depth of grief.	
	
    To weigh against his opposite; or else	
	
    To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?	
	
    To whom I sued for my dear son's life;	
	
    To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:	
	
    To whom the foragers shall all repair,	
	
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things	
	
    To win thy after-love I pardon thee.	
	
    To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,	
	
    To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.	
	
    To you I am bound for life and education;	
	
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.	
	
    To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.	
	
    To your remembrances; but you have found,	
	
    To-morrow I shall die with mickle age.	
	
    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;	
	
    To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,	
	
    To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day	
	
    Together have one dust, yet reverence-	
	
    Together with the terror of the place-	
	
    Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, serv'd	
	
    Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her-	
	
    Too great for what contains it. 'Boy'! O slave!	
	
    Too much the rein; the strongest oaths are straw	
	
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,	
	
    Torment myself to catch the English crown;	
	
    Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,	
	
    Toward that shade I might behold addrest	
	
    Toward this remedy, whereupon we are	
	
    Traduc'd by odious ballads; my maiden's name	
	
    Transform us not to women.	
	
    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!	
	
    Treason, my lord- Lavinia is surpris'd!	
	
    Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!	
	
    Troilus.	
	
    Troop in the throngs of military men;	
	
    Troyan drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent. I'll after.	
	
    Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt	
	
    Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.	
	
    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.	
	
    Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults	
	
    Turning with splendour of his precious eye	
	
    Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting.	
	
    Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone	
	
    Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,	
	
    Two things provided more; that, for this favour,	
	
    Ugly, and sland'rous to thy mother's womb,	
	
    Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.	
	
    Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;	
	
    Uncle, you say the Queen is at your house;	
	
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;	
	
    Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat;	
	
    Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain	
	
    Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,	
	
    Under these windows white and azure, lac'd	
	
    Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,	
	
    Uneven is the course; I like it not.	
	
    Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up	
	
    Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,	
	
    Unless by using means I lame the foot	
	
    Unless my hand and strength could equal them.	
	
    Unless the adage must be verified,	
	
    Unless this general evil they maintain,	
	
    Unless you can find sport in their intents,	
	
    Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray your pardon.	
	
    Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?	
	
    Unsafe the while, that we	
	
    Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently.	
	
    Until I meet the King.	
	
    Until a king be by, and then his state	
	
    Until my husband bid me.	
	
    Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.	
	
    Unto a dunghill, which shall be thy grave,	
	
    Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.	
	
    Unto the citizens, who haply may	
	
    Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.	
	
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body	
	
    Unto your Grace do I in chief address	
	
    Unworthy as I am, to follow you.	
	
    Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,	
	
    Upon Saint Davy's day.	
	
    Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts	
	
    Upon a sore injunction; my sweet mistress	
	
    Upon entreaty have a present alms;	
	
    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!	
	
    Upon his honour'd finger, to attain	
	
    Upon his son; who, high in name and power,	
	
    Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms	
	
    Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!	
	
    Upon offenders hath exceeded law,	
	
    Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.	
	
    Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;	
	
    Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!	
	
    Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,	
	
    Upon the like devotion as yourselves,	
	
    Upon the parting of your wives and you.	
	
    Upon the power and puissance of the King.	
	
    Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love	
	
    Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.                 Exeunt	
	
    Upon this fairest prisoner.     [Puts a bracelet on her arm]	
	
    Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength,	
	
    Upon whose property and most dear life	
	
    Upon's again.	
	
    Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,	
	
    Using those thoughts which should indeed have died	
	
    Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,	
	
    Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going	
	
    Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of	
	
    Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,	
	
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-	
	
    Virtuous and holy, chosen from above	
	
    Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,	
	
    Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage,	
	
    Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado, and made Lucifer cuckold,	
	
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;	
	
    Warrants these words in princely courtesy.	
	
    Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I cry you mercy. I	
	
    Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia.	
	
    Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes-	
	
    Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,	
	
    Was either pitied in him or forgotten.	
	
    Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.	
	
    Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord.	
	
    Was made much poorer by it; but your son,	
	
    Was my dear friend; what malice was between you?	
	
    Was not Gaunt just? and is not Harry true?	
	
    Was parmacity for an inward bruise;	
	
    Was re-united to the Crown of France.	
	
    Was this inserted to make interest good?	
	
    Was to be trusted with them.	
	
    Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss	
	
    We English warriors wot not what it means.	
	
    We are again forsworn in will and error.	
	
    We are impressed and engag'd to fight-	
	
    We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.	
	
    We are undone, lady, we are undone!	
	
    We cannot feel too little, hear too much.	
	
    We carry not a heart with us from hence	
	
    We do instate and widow you withal	
	
    We do request your kindest ears; and, after,	
	
    We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.	
	
    We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.	
	
    We have at disadvantage fought, and did	
	
    We have had pastimes here, and pleasant game;	
	
    We have willing dames enough; there cannot be	
	
    We kept together in our chivalry.'	
	
    We let the people know't.	
	
    We make a choir, as doth the prison'd bird,	
	
    We may the number of the ships behold,	
	
    We must awake endeavour for defence,	
	
    We must not think the Turk is so unskillful	
	
    We now present. Those that can pity here	
	
    We please them not by land.	
	
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,	
	
    We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.	
	
    We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.	
	
    We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?	
	
    We should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten'd	
	
    We tread upon, and never think of it.	
	
    We were elected theirs: Marcius is worthy	
	
    We will bear home that lusty blood again	
	
    We will have rings and things, and fine array;	
	
    We will in France, by God's grace, play a set	
	
    We will with some strange pastime solace them,	
	
    We write in water. May it please your Highness	
	
    We'll borrow place of him. [To ANGELO] Sir, by your leave.	
	
    We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;	
	
    We'll keep him here. Then what is that to him?	
	
    We'll not be nice; take hands. We will not dance.	
	
    We'll pass the business privately and well.	
	
    We'll speak with thee at sea; at land thou know'st	
	
    We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,	
	
    We, poising us in her defective scale,	
	
    Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,	
	
    Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke thy head for	
	
    Weep our sad bosoms empty.	
	
    Welcome before the gates of Angiers, Duke.	
	
    Welcome, Aemilius. What's the news from Rome?	
	
    Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor.	
	
    Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;	
	
    Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,	
	
    Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;	
	
    Well, do not then; for since you love me not,	
	
    Well, sir, what follows?	
	
    Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail	
	
    Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.	
	
    Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;	
	
    Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,	
	
    Were fit for thee to use, as they to claim,	
	
    Were growing time once ripened to my will.	
	
    Were in the Washes all unwarily	
	
    Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven?	
	
    Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier	
	
    Were present when she finish'd.	
	
    Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains!	
	
    Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue	
	
    Were to import forgetfulness in me.	
	
    Were't not all one an empty eagle were set	
	
    Were, in his time, thought false; and Sinon's weeping	
	
    What 'twere to lose it and be miserable!	
	
    What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested the	
	
    What I have done being young, or what would do,	
	
    What air's from home. Haply this life is best,	
	
    What are you?	
	
    What brings you here to court so hastily?	
	
    What canst thou swear by now?	
	
    What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;	
	
    What crows have peck'd them here. He brags his service,	
	
    What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?	
	
    What doth her beauty serve but as a note	
	
    What figure of us think you he will bear?	
	
    What friendship may I do thee?	
	
    What harm a wind too great might do at sea.	
	
    What hath proceeded worthy note today.	
	
    What he will do. But if he will not yield,	
	
    What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge	
	
    What is become of Bushy? Where is Green?	
	
    What is it else? A madness most discreet,	
	
    What is the issue of the business there.	
	
    What is the news?	
	
    What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?	
	
    What is't o'clock?	
	
    What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?	
	
    What majesty is in her gait? Remember,	
	
    What may she not? She may-ay, marry, may she-	
	
    What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?	
	
    What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?	
	
    What news from Oxford? Do these justs and triumphs hold?	
	
    What peremptory eagle-sighted eye	
	
    What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?	
	
    What say the augurers?	
	
    What say you to that?	
	
    What says King Bolingbroke? Will his Majesty	
	
    What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life	
	
    What shall defend the interim? And at length	
	
    What should I don this robe and trouble you?	
	
    What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty	
	
    What the vengeance, could he not speak 'em fair?	
	
    What think'st thou? Is it not an easy matter	
	
    What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!	
	
    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light	
	
    What viler thing upon the earth than friends,	
	
    What watchful cares do interpose themselves	
	
    What will be said? What mockery will it be	
	
    What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband	
	
    What would you have me do? I am a subject,	
	
    What you commanded me, but by her woman	
	
    What you will have it nam'd, even that it is,	
	
    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,	
	
    What's mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.	
	
    What's this but libelling against the Senate,	
	
    What, Davy, I say!	
	
    What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;	
	
    What, can so young a man begin to prick?	
	
    What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,	
	
    What, is it a time to jest and dally now?	
	
    What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?	
	
    What, out of hearing gone? No sound, no word?	
	
    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!	
	
    What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian	
	
    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof	
	
    When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,	
	
    When I am absent, then lie with my wife.	
	
    When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.	
	
    When I do name him, let it be thy part	
	
    When I do weep, they humbly at my feet	
	
    When I perceive your Grace, like pow'r divine,	
	
    When I shall think or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd	
	
    When I spake darkly what I purposed,	
	
    When Imogen is dead.	
	
    When Oxford had me down, he rescued me	
	
    When all the world is here to look on me?	
	
    When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;	
	
    When death doth close his tender dying eyes,	
	
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,	
	
    When evils are most free? O, then, by day	
	
    When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;	
	
    When have I injur'd thee? when done thee wrong,	
	
    When he doth run his course. Antonio!	
	
    When he sees me go back one foot or flee.             Exeunt	
	
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.	
	
    When in that moment, so it came to pass,	
	
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever	
	
    When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones.	
	
    When least in company. Prosper well in this,	
	
    When most impeached, stands least in thy control.	
	
    When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,	
	
    When rage and hot blood are his counsellors	
	
    When right with right wars who shall be most right!	
	
    When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?	
	
    When she has so much English.	
	
    When subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam's Troy.	
	
    When that my care could not withhold thy riots,	
	
    When that this body did contain a spirit,	
	
    When the false Troyan under sail was seen,	
	
    When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;	
	
    When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.	
	
    When this is known, then to divide the times-	
	
    When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' th' air,	
	
    When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.	
	
    When time shall serve, to show in articles;	
	
    When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended	
	
    When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,	
	
    When we would bring him on to some confession	
	
    When with your blood you daily paint her thus.	
	
    When you curse them as enemies.	
	
    When you do find him, or alive or dead,	
	
    When you perceive his blood inclin'd to mirth;	
	
    When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!	
	
    When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;	
	
    Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman-	
	
    Where God He knows how we shall answer him;	
	
    Where I have took them up.	
	
    Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,	
	
    Where and what time your Majesty shall please.	
	
    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,	
	
    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.	
	
    Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!	
	
    Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.	
	
    Where hadst thou it?	
	
    Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask	
	
    Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word	
	
    Where is Malvolio?	
	
    Where is my wife?	
	
    Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?	
	
    Where is the foolish knave I sent before?	
	
    Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.	
	
    Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung	
	
    Where most you owe obedience?	
	
    Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both	
	
    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me	
	
    Where prayers cross.	
	
    Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?	
	
    Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,	
	
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,	
	
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?	
	
    Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.	
	
    Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.	
	
    Where you and Douglas, and our pow'rs at once,	
	
    Where's Bardolph?	
	
    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?	
	
    Where, being but young, I framed to the harp	
	
    Whereby my son is disinherited.	
	
    Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.	
	
    Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?	
	
    Wherein have you been galled by the King;	
	
    Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves.	
	
    Wherein this trunk was fram'd, and in her hand	
	
    Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear	
	
    Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are	
	
    Whereof the King my brother was possess'd.	
	
    Whereon Hyperion's quick'ning fire doth shine-	
	
    Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave.	
	
    Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd	
	
    Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell.	
	
    Whether till the next night she had rather stay,	
	
    Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,	
	
    Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,	
	
    Which I disdaining scorn'd, and craved death	
	
    Which I have sometime known.	
	
    Which I left with her?	
	
    Which I respect not. I did send to you	
	
    Which I, the factor for the rest, have done	
	
    Which are so weak of courage and in judgment	
	
    Which art a lion and the king of beasts?	
	
    Which better fits a lion than a man.	
	
    Which by his death hath lost much majesty.	
	
    Which cannot go but thirty mile a day,	
	
    Which craves as desperate an execution	
	
    Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time	
	
    Which ent'red their frail shins. At last I left them	
	
    Which ever in the haunch of winter sings	
	
    Which for our goods we do no further ask	
	
    Which from the womb I did participate.	
	
    Which had superfluous kings for messengers	
	
    Which he confesseth to be manifold,	
	
    Which he shall have. I'll pay the debt, and free him.	
	
    Which here we came to spout against your town,	
	
    Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,	
	
    Which holds not colour with the time, nor does	
	
    Which in the day of battle tire thee more	
	
    Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,	
	
    Which is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.	
	
    Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans,	
	
    Which is the ladder of all high designs,	
	
    Which likes me better than to wish us one.	
	
    Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion	
	
    Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows.	
	
    Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,	
	
    Which my lord paid for be of any power	
	
    Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.	
	
    Which now in some slight measure it will pay,	
	
    Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,	
	
    Which often, since my here-remain in England,	
	
    Which out of daily fortune ever taints	
	
    Which quier'd with my drum, into a pipe	
	
    Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay	
	
    Which shall to all our nights and days to come	
	
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.	
	
    Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,	
	
    Which so-long-sund'red friends should dwell upon.	
	
    Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;	
	
    Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes	
	
    Which then they had to take from 's, to resume	
	
    Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life	
	
    Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name	
	
    Which time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be-	
	
    Which to recure, we heartily solicit	
	
    Which was not half so beautiful and kind;	
	
    Which was so strongly urg'd past my defence.	
	
    Which way thou travellest- if along with us,	
	
    Which we will niggard with a little rest.	
	
    Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,	
	
    Which with experimental seal doth warrant	
	
    Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,	
	
    Which you have promised I shall possess.	
	
    Which you weep for.	
	
    Which, as it seems, make thee.	
	
    Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.	
	
    Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,	
	
    Which, in a napkin being close convey'd,	
	
    Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.	
	
    Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-	
	
    Which, with pain purchas'd, doth inherit pain,	
	
    While I make way from hence to save my life.	
	
    While he enjoys the honour and his ease.	
	
    While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,	
	
    While they do tend the profit of the land.	
	
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,	
	
    Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,	
	
    Whiles that his mountain sire- on mountain standing,	
	
    Whiles thou art waking.	
	
    Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,	
	
    Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste	
	
    Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.	
	
    Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,	
	
    White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?	
	
    Whither I go, nor reason whereabout.	
	
    Who I myself struck down. And thence it is	
	
    Who are surpris'd withal; but my rejoicing	
	
    Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,	
	
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?	
	
    Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?	
	
    Who dares not stand his foe I'll be his friend;	
	
    Who died and was Fidele. What think you?	
	
    Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,	
	
    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,	
	
    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,	
	
    Who hath descried the number of the traitors?	
	
    Who in a moment even with the earth	
	
    Who is it that hath died for this offence?	
	
    Who is't can read a woman? Is there more?	
	
    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,	
	
    Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp	
	
    Who may, in th' ambush of my name, strike home,	
	
    Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch	
	
    Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling	
	
    Who shall reward you better for my life	
	
    Who should attend on him? He makes up the file	
	
    Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,	
	
    Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever	
	
    Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury	
	
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.	
	
    Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld	
	
    Who would give a bird the he, though he cry 'cuckoo' never so?	
	
    Who's that that bears the sceptre?	
	
    Who, after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king	
	
    Who, busied in his majesty, surveys	
	
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears	
	
    Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,	
	
    Who, when he knows thou art the Empress' babe,	
	
    Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-	
	
    Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,	
	
    Whom I with all the office of my heart	
	
    Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children	
	
    Whom like a school-boy you may overawe.	
	
    Whom sometime I have laugh'd with. Let your Highness	
	
    Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,	
	
    Whom you pretend to honour and adore,	
	
    Whose absence is no less material to me	
	
    Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof-	
	
    Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.	
	
    Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.	
	
    Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,	
	
    Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.	
	
    Whose fault is this?	
	
    Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.	
	
    Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England	
	
    Whose hours the peasant best advantages.	
	
    Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,	
	
    Whose love is never link'd to the deserver	
	
    Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,	
	
    Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,	
	
    Whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd,	
	
    Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.	
	
    Whose state so many had the managing	
	
    Whose ugly and unnatural aspect	
	
    Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;	
	
    Why I descend into this bed of death	
	
    Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,	
	
    Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,	
	
    Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!	
	
    Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?	
	
    Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack	
	
    Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force	
	
    Why in that rawness left you wife and child,	
	
    Why should I war without the walls of Troy	
	
    Why should he call her whore? Who keeps her company?	
	
    Why sinks that cauldron, and what noise is this?	
	
    Why the law Salique, that they have in France,	
	
    Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!	
	
    Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?	
	
    Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,	
	
    Why, Jessica, I say!	
	
    Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done;	
	
    Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?	
	
    Why, that's the lady! All the world desires her;	
	
    Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house!	
	
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!	
	
    Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?	
	
    Will Fortune never come with both hands full,	
	
    Will I set up my everlasting rest	
	
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,	
	
    Will bring this labour to an happy end.                    Exeunt	
	
    Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.	
	
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,	
	
    Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;	
	
    Will he conduct you through the heart of France,	
	
    Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,	
	
    Will make but little for his benefit.	
	
    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.	
	
    Will not confess he owes the malady	
	
    Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?	
	
    Will parley with Jack Cade their general.	
	
    Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,	
	
    Will serve the turn.	
	
    Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves	
	
    Will these turtles be gone?	
	
    Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,	
	
    Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,	
	
    Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,	
	
    Will you go on? [Aside.] This is the night	
	
    Will you with free and unconstrained soul	
	
    Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?	
	
    Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,            [Music]	
	
    Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast	
	
    Windsor leads a better life than she does; do what she will,	
	
    Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.	
	
    With Cassio's suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,	
	
    With Henry's death the English circle ends;	
	
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,	
	
    With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them	
	
    With all his covent, honourably receiv'd him;	
	
    With all religious strength of sacred vows;	
	
    With all the fierce endeavour of your wit,	
	
    With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.	
	
    With an importing visage; and she told me	
	
    With any just reproach?	
	
    With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.	
	
    With blood of thine already.	
	
    With brazen din blast you the city's ear;	
	
    With chaces. And we understand him well,	
	
    With clamorous demands of date-broke bonds	
	
    With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,	
	
    With ears that sweep away the morning dew;	
	
    With every several pleasure in the world;	
	
    With fear and horrid flight.	
	
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.	
	
    With foul and violent tempest.	
	
    With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales	
	
    With hair up-staring-then like reeds, not hair-	
	
    With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;	
	
    With him is Gratiano gone along;	
	
    With his inducement.	
	
    With honour and with fortune is return'd	
	
    With humble and familiar courtesy;	
	
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,	
	
    With letters of commission from the King.	
	
    With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!	
	
    With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,	
	
    With men like you, men of inconstancy.	
	
    With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.          [Alarum]	
	
    With much more ease; for my good will is to it,	
	
    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead	
	
    With observation, the which he vents	
	
    With open outcry, toward our monument.	
	
    With ourselves.	
	
    With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.	
	
    With profits of the mind, study and fast.	
	
    With resolution whereso'er I meet thee-	
	
    With reverend fathers and well learned bishops.	
	
    With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats	
	
    With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.	
	
    With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!	
	
    With some fine colour that may please the eye	
	
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,	
	
    With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing,	
	
    With such integrity, she did confess	
	
    With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,	
	
    With that dread King that took our state upon Him	
	
    With that keen appetite that he sits down?	
	
    With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends	
	
    With the first glance that ever-pardon me.	
	
    With the plebeians swarming at their heels-	
	
    With thee and all thy best parts bound together,	
	
    With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,	
	
    With this same very iron to burn them out.	
	
    With this thy fair and outward character.	
	
    With thy confederates in this weighty cause.            Exit	
	
    With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades	
	
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,	
	
    With twenty trenched gashes on his head,	
	
    With wanton Paris sleeps-and that's the quarrel.	
	
    With what his valour did enrich his wit,	
	
    With whom yourself, myself, and other lords,	
	
    With winged heels, as English Mercuries.	
	
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;	
	
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-	
	
    Withdrew me from the odds of multitude.	
	
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd	
	
    Within so small a time, my woman's heart	
	
    Within the book and volume of my brain,	
	
    Within these three days let me hear thee say	
	
    Within two days for this.	
	
    Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.	
	
    Without her, follows to myself and thee,	
	
    Without impeachment; for, to say the sooth-	
	
    Without my stir.	
	
    Without the peril of the Athenian law-	
	
    Without the which a soldier and his sword

    Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,	
	
    Worthy the owner and the owner it.	
	
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven	
	
    Would any of the stock of Barrabas	
	
    Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,	
	
    Would choose him Pope, and carry him to Rome,	
	
    Would for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd	
	
    Would have inform'd for preparation.	
	
    Would he were a Troyan!	
	
    Would long ere this have met us on the way.	
	
    Would move a monster.	
	
    Would run to these and these extremities;	
	
    Would scatter all her spices on the stream,	
	
    Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! [Trumpet within.]	
	
    Would use his heaven for thunder,	
	
    Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome.	
	
    Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.

    You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse	
	
    You and your crafts! You have crafted fair!	
	
    You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let alone;	
	
    You are deceiv'd; for what I mean to do	
	
    You are still crossing it. Sirs, let 't alone;	
	
    You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow.	
	
    You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am	
	
    You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?	
	
    You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,	
	
    You cannot reason almost with a man	
	
    You cannot tent yourself; be gone, beseech you.	
	
    You do him injury to scorn his corse.	
	
    You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans,	
	
    You fled for vantage, every one will swear;	
	
    You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:	
	
    You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with thankfulness.	
	
    You had of her pure honour gains or loses	
	
    You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella	
	
    You have misled a prince, a royal king,	
	
    You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw	
	
    You have show'd a tender fatherly regard	
	
    You knew my father well, and in him me,	
	
    You know a sword employ'd is perilous,	
	
    You know your mother means to feast with me,	
	
    You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!	
	
    You made great Juno angry.	
	
    You make strong party, or defend yourself	
	
    You may have every day enough of Hector,	
	
    You may pace easy, but not such a wife.	
	
    You more invest it! Ebbing men indeed,	
	
    You must no more call it York Place: that's past:	
	
    You must not stay here longer; your dismission	
	
    You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,	
	
    You of your wife, and me of my consent,	
	
    You put our page out. Go, you are allow'd;	
	
    You see how simple and how fond I am.	
	
    You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?	
	
    You shall have me assisting you in all.	
	
    You shall not make me welcome.	
	
    You shall yourself read in the bitter letter	
	
    You should have been well on your way to York.	
	
    You something know; yet I believe there comes	
	
    You stand in coldest expectation.	
	
    You take my house when you do take the prop	
	
    You tender to her; that you in all obey her,	
	
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,	
	
    You think of other place. Th' ambassador,	
	
    You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,	
	
    You were about to speak.	
	
    You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'	
	
    You will not do it, you!	
	
    You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag.	
	
    You would have slipp'd like him; but he, like you,	
	
    You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house.	
	
    You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!	
	
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,	
	
    You, sir, what trade are you?	
	
    Young Bertram.	
	
    Young fry of treachery!	
	
    Your Grace's pardon; and I hope I had it.	
	
    Your Highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,	
	
    Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old,	
	
    Your aprons mountant; you are not oathable,

    Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men	
	
    Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,	
	
    Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.	
	
    Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;	
	
    Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride	
	
    Your importunacy cease till after dinner,	
	
    Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,	
	
    Your lordship is a guest too.	
	
    Your master wed me to: nothing but death	
	
    Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-	
	
    Your noble and right well-rememb'red father's?	
	
    Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.	
	
    Your passion draws ears hither.	
	
    Your potent and infectious fevers heap	
	
    Your roof were not sufficient to contain 't.	
	
    Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat,	
	
    Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.	
	
    Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.	
	
    Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.	
	
    Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.

  ANNE. What is it?	
	
  ANTONIO, a merchant of Venice	
	
  ANTONIO, his brother, the usurping Duke of Milan	
	
  ANTONIO. Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,	
	
  ANTONIO. Fie, fie!	
	
  ANTONIO. Hang, cur; hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker;	
	
  ANTONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,	
	
  ANTONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew.	
	
  ANTONIO. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse;	
	
  ANTONIO. Nor I; my spirits are nimble.	
	
  ANTONIO. Put up your sword. If this young gentleman	
	
  ANTONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law;	
	
  ANTONIO. The visitor will not give him o'er so.	
	
  ANTONIO. Very foul.	
	
  ANTONIO. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first	
	
  ANTONIO.Th' offence is not of such a bloody nature;	
	
  ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me	
	
  ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might	
	
  ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.	
	
  ANTONY. Dead then?	
	
  ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!	
	
  ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.	
	
  ANTONY. How, my love?	
	
  ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear	
	
  ANTONY. I have offended reputation-	
	
  ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.	
	
  ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch	
	
  ANTONY. Most sweet queen-	
	
  ANTONY. No more light answers. Let our officers	
	
  ANTONY. O, quick, or I am gone.	
	
  ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,	
	
  ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,	
	
  ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,	
	
  ANTONY. The gods best know-	
	
  ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,	
	
  ANTONY. Thou bleed'st apace.	
	
  ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before	
	
  ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then	
	
  ANTONY. Who's gone this morning?	
	
  ANTONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept	
	
  APEMANTUS. A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.	
	
  APEMANTUS. Art thou proud yet?	
	
  APEMANTUS. Flow this way! A brave fellow! He keeps his tides well.	
	
  APEMANTUS. He last ask'd the question. Poor rogues and usurers'	
	
  APEMANTUS. I was directed hither. Men report	
	
  APEMANTUS. No; I eat not lords.	
	
  APEMANTUS. So. Thou wilt not hear me now: thou shalt not then. I'll	
	
  APEMANTUS. That you ask me what you are, and do not know	
	
  APEMANTUS. To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.	
	
  APEMANTUS. What wouldst thou have to Athens?	
	
  APEMANTUS. Yes.	
	
  ARCHBISHOP. 'Tis well done.	
	
  ARCHBISHOP. Let us on,

  ARIEL. Ay, sir.	
	
  ARIEL. I thank thee, master.	
	
  ARIEL. Not a soul	
	
  ARIEL. Thou liest.	
	
  ARMADO.  The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,	
	
  ARMADO. By heart and in heart, boy.	
	
  ARMADO. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,	
	
  ARMADO. Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love	
	
  ARMADO. I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!	
	
  ARMADO. I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton	
	
  ARMADO. Men of peace, well encount'red.	
	
  ARMADO. Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.	
	
  ARMADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward	
	
  ARMADO. The way is but short; away.	
	
  ARMADO. What wilt thou prove?	
	
  ARTHUR. Alas, what need you be so boist'rous rough?	
	
  ARTHUR. Good my mother, peace!	
	
  ARTHUR. O, this will make my mother die with grief!	
	
  ARVIRAGUS. Hail, heaven!	
	
  ARVIRAGUS. It is not likely	
	
  ARVIRAGUS. Nobly he yokes	
	
  ARVIRAGUS. Thus did he answer me; yet said hereafter	
	
  ARVIRAGUS. Your health. [To BELARIUS] So please you, sir.	
	
  AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?	
	
  AUFIDIUS. Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd	
	
  AUFIDIUS. Insolent villain!	
	
  AUFIDIUS. My lords, when you shall know- as in this rage,	
	
  AUFIDIUS. What is thy name?	
	
  AUFIDIUS. Why, noble lords,	
	
  AUMERLE. I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.	
	
  AUMERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,	
	
  AUMERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?	
	
  AUMERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air	
	
  AUSTRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords	
	
  Abr. You lie.	
	
  After you first forswore it on the mart;	
	
  Against thy reasons making no defence.	
	
  Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,	
	
  Alb. Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.	
	
  Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in;	
	
  Alb. Our very loving sister, well bemet.	
	
  Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.	
	
  Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,	
	
  Alb. Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.	
	
  All. Gentlemen!	
	
  Alone, it was the subject of my theme;	
	
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;	
	
  And I a tyrant have no leisure taken	
	
  And age in love, loves not to have years told.	
	
  And all the conduits of my blood froze up,	
	
  And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.	
	
  And by a part of all thy glory live:	
	
  And by their verdict is determined	
	
  And do not drop in for an after-loss:	
	
  And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,	
	
  And for the same he promis'd me a chain;	
	
  And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner;	
	
  And gives thy pen both skill and argument.	
	
  And husband nature's riches from expense,	
	
  And in my madness might speak ill of thee,	
	
  And in this mist at all adventures go.	
	
  And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;	
	
  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,	
	
  And me they left with those of Epidamnum.	
	
  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.	
	
  And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.	
	
  And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,	
	
  And simple truth miscalled simplicity,	
	
  And soon to you, as you to me then tendered	
	
  And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,	
	
  And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.	
	
  And that supposed by the common rout	
	
  And the sad augurs mock their own presage,	
	
  And therefore from my face she turns my foes,	
	
  And these two Dromios, one in semblance-	
	
  And threescore year would make the world away:	
	
  And under thee their poesy disperse.	
	
  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?	
	
  And with his presence grace impiety,	
	
  And yet methinks I have astronomy,	
	
  And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,	
	
  And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.	
	
  Ant. A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him	
	
  Ant. Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.	
	
  Antonio, an old man, his brother.	
	
  Arch. Like enough you do.	
	
  Are penitent for your default to-day.	
	
  As after sunset fadeth in the west,	
	
  As interest of the dead, which now appear,	
	
  As testy sick men when their deaths be near,	
	
  As you love strokes, so jest with me again.	
	
  At first the very worst of fortune's might.	
	
  Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,	
	
  BANDITTI. Soldiers, not thieves.	
	
  BANQUO. Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear	
	
  BANQUO. My lord, I will not.	
	
  BANQUO. What, can the devil speak true?	
	
  BAPTISTA. A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good Cambio.	
	
  BAPTISTA. Didst thou not say he comes?	
	
  BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, that I may soon make good	
	
  BAPTISTA. I'll after him and see the event of this.	
	
  BAPTISTA. Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.	
	
  BAPTISTA. Son, I'll be your half Bianca comes.	
	
  BAPTISTA. Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?	
	
  BARDOLPH. An you do not make him be hang'd among you, the gallows	
	
  BARDOLPH. Away, you rogue.	
	
  BARDOLPH. Farewell, hostess.                     [Kissing her]	
	
  BARDOLPH. Here, sir.	
	
  BARDOLPH. Pardon, sir; I have heard the word. 'Phrase' call you it?	
	
  BARDOLPH. Well said; th'art a good fellow.	
	
  BARNARDINE, a dissolute prisoner	
	
  BARNARDINE. [Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that noise	
	
  BASSANIO. Be assur'd you may.	
	
  BASSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;	
	
  BASSANIO. If it please you to dine with us.	
	
  BASSANIO. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,	
	
  BASSANIO. Since I have your good leave to go away,	
	
  BASSANIO. Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.	
	
  BASSET. And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.	
	
  BASSIANUS. Ay, noble Titus, and resolv'd withal	
	
  BASSIANUS. Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy	
	
  BASTARD. And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.	
	
  BASTARD. Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind	
	
  BASTARD. Go, bear him in thine arms.	
	
  BASTARD. Ha, majesty! how high thy glory tow'rs	
	
  BASTARD. How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging wood,	
	
  BASTARD. Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!	
	
  BASTARD. O, let us pay the time but needful woe,	
	
  BASTARD. Philip-Sparrow! James,	
	
  BASTARD. The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.	
	
  BASTARD. Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.	
	
  BATES. Be friends, you English fools, be friends; we have	
	
  BEDFORD. He is as full of valour as of kindness;	
	
  BEDFORD. His ransom there is none but I shall pay.	
	
  BELARIUS. A goodly day not to keep house with such	
	
  BELARIUS. How you speak!	
	
  BELARIUS. It shall be so.	
	
  BELARIUS. Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill,	
	
  BELARIUS. Those runagates?	
	
  BELARIUS. Well, 'tis done.	
	
  BEROWNE. 'All hid, all hid'- an old infant play.	
	
  BEROWNE. Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;	
	
  BEROWNE. And three times thrice is nine.	
	
  BEROWNE. Because thou hast no face.	
	
  BEROWNE. Fit in his place and time.	
	
  BEROWNE. I can but say their protestation over;	
	
  BEROWNE. Is ebony like her? O wood divine!	
	
  BEROWNE. My good knave Costard, exceedingly well met!	
	
  BEROWNE. Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!	
	
  BEROWNE. Our wooing doth not end like an old play:	
	
  BEROWNE. Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!	
	
  BEROWNE. The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool, and	
	
  BEROWNE. Thou grievest my gall.	
	
  BEROWNE. Well said, old mocker; I must needs be friends with thee.	
	
  BEROWNE. What's her name in the cap?	
	
  BEROWNE. Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.	
	
  BEROWNE. [Descending] Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy,	
	
  BERTRAM. Both, both; o, pardon!	
	
  BERTRAM. Change it, change it;	
	
  BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.	
	
  BERTRAM. I have to-night dispatch'd sixteen businesses, a month's	
	
  BERTRAM. I think so.	
	
  BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.	
	
  BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has 'a?	
	
  BERTRAM. There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know	
	
  BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?	
	
  BIANCA	
	
  BIANCA.  [Reads]	
	
  BIANCA. Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?	
	
  BIANCA. He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.	
	
  BIANCA. That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.	
	
  BIANCA. Where left we last?	
	
  BIONDELLO. Help, help, help! Here's a madman will murder me.	
	
  BIONDELLO. Master, a mercatante or a pedant,	
	
  BIONDELLO. No, sir; I say his horse comes with him on his back.	
	
  BIONDELLO. Why, sir, he comes not.

  BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle, let me know my fault;	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. First-heaven be the record to my speech!

  BOLINGBROKE. Mine innocence and Saint George to thrive!	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. O heinous, strong, and bold conspiracy!	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues	
	
  BOLINGBROKE. [Reads] 'First of the king: what shall of him become?'	
	
  BOTH TRIBUNES. Farewell, farewell.             Exeunt citizens	
	
  BOTH TRIBUNES. Why, how are we censur'd?	
	
  BOTH. Doubt it not, worthy lord.	
	
  BOTH. Wherefore? wherefore?	
	
  BOTTOM. I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to	
	
  BOTTOM. No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.	
	
  BOTTOM. Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet-	
	
  BOTTOM. Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play	
	
  BOY.             As duly, but not as truly,	
	
  BOY. As young as I am, I have observ'd these three swashers. I am	
	
  BOY. He prays you to save his life; he is a gentleman of a good	
	
  BOY. Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master; and your	
	
  BOYET. A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!	
	
  BOYET. Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.	
	
  BOYET. I am bound to serve.	
	
  BOYET. Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:	
	
  BOYET. She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.	
	
  BOYET. The pommel of Coesar's falchion.	
	
  BOYET. They will, they will, God knows,	
	
  BOYET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,	
	
  BRABANTIO.                How? The Duke in council?	
	
  BRABANTIO.            A maiden never bold,	
	
  BRABANTIO. What profane wretch art thou?	
	
  BRAKENBURY. Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,	
	
  BRANDON. He.	
	
  BRUTUS. 'Tis most like he will.	
	
  BRUTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?	
	
  BRUTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these?	
	
  BRUTUS. By your pardon,	
	
  BRUTUS. Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.	
	
  BRUTUS. Did you perceive	
	
  BRUTUS. Fates, we will know your pleasures.	
	
  BRUTUS. Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends	
	
  BRUTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.	
	
  BRUTUS. He is welcome hither.	
	
  BRUTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.	
	
  BRUTUS. I know that we shall have him well to friend.	
	
  BRUTUS. In this point charge him home, that he affects	
	
  BRUTUS. It does, my boy.	
	
  BRUTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.	
	
  BRUTUS. Merely awry. When he did love his country,	
	
  BRUTUS. No.	
	
  BRUTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us!	
	
  BRUTUS. Or let us stand to our authority	
	
  BRUTUS. Prepare the body then, and follow us.	
	
  BRUTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.	
	
  BRUTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,	
	
  BRUTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;	
	
  BRUTUS. They are all welcome.	
	
  BRUTUS. We'll hear no more.	
	
  BRUTUS. Where's Publius?	
	
  BRUTUS. Why shall the people give	
	
  BRUTUS. You know the very road into his kindness	
	
  BRUTUS. You say you are a better soldier:	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. And is it thus? Repays he my deep service	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. He'll wrest the sense, and hold us here all day.	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal,	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom-	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shall we do if we	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke;	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold:	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. We know each other's faces; for our hearts,	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Why let it strike?	
	
  BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,	
	
  BURGUNDY. And I to this.	
	
  BURGUNDY. Is she not apt?	
	
  BURGUNDY. What Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.	
	
  BUSHY. The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland.	
	
  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.	
	
  Balth. And an ill singer, my lord.	
	
  Bar. Case ye, case ye! On with your vizards! There's money of the	
	
  Bard. Indeed, Sir John, you said so.	
	
  Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,	
	
  Be mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'	
	
  Beat. A very even way, but no such friend.	
	
  Beat. Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right	
	
  Beat. He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway	
	
  Beat. I cry you mercy, uncle, By your Grace's pardon.    Exit.	
	
  Beat. Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use for	
	
  Beat. Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am	
	
  Beat. Nor will you not tell me who you are?	
	
  Beat. Speak, Count, 'tis your cue.	
	
  Beat. Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion	
	
  Beat. Will you not eat your word?	
	
  Beat. Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knives point, and	
	
  Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:	
	
  Beheaded publicly for his offence.	
	
  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy	
	
  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees	
	
  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.	
	
  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.	
	
  Ben. Soft! I will go along.	
	
  Ben. The what?	
	
  Ben. What, art thou hurt?	
	
  Bene. And therefore will come.	
	
  Bene. Do not you love me?	
	
  Bene. God keep your ladyship still in that mind! So some gentleman	
	
  Bene. Ha! not for the wide world!	
	
  Bene. I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried thy	
	
  Bene. In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek	
	
  Bene. Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is	
	
  Bene. Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for	
	
  Bene. Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?	
	
  Bene. The flat transgression of a schoolboy who, being overjoyed	
	
  Bene. Two of them have the very bent of honour;	
	
  Bene. Why, then your uncle, and the Prince, and Claudio	
	
  Bene. Your answer, sir, is enigmatical;	
	
  Ber. He.	
	
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.	
	
  Besides her urging of her wreck at sea-	
	
  Beyond all date even to eternity.	
	
  Blunt. I would you would accept of grace and love.	
	
  Bora. Conrade, I say!	
	
  Bora. If you would know your wronger, look on me.	
	
  Bora. Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo	
	
  Bora. Yea, even I alone.	
	
  Both truth and beauty on my love depends:	
	
  Both. Yea, sir, we hope.	
	
  Bur. Royal Lear,	
	
  But as the marigold at the sun's eye,	
	
  But be contented when that fell arrest,	
	
  But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky.	
	
  But if that flower with base infection meet,	
	
  But my five wits, nor my five senses can	
	
  But she, more covetous, would have a chain.	
	
  But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:	
	
  But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail,	
	
  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,	
	
  But wherefore do not you a mightier way	
	
  Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.	
	
  By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground	
	
  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!	
	
  By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown	
	
  CADE. Away with him, and do as I command ye.  [Exeunt some with	
	
  CADE. Come then, let's go fight with them. But first go and set	
	
  CADE. Iden, farewell; and be proud of thy victory. Tell Kent from	
	
  CADE. Nay, he nods at us, as who should say 'I'll be even with	
	
  CADE. Valiant I am.	
	
  CAESAR. Adieu; be happy!

  CAESAR. Forbear, Seleucus.                       Exit SELEUCUS	
	
  CAESAR. Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.	
	
  CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.	
	
  CAESAR. I wrote to you	
	
  CAESAR. Most probable	
	
  CAESAR. Poison'd then.	
	
  CAESAR. Set him before me let me see his face.	
	
  CAESAR. That ever I should call thee cast-away!	
	
  CAESAR. Welcome to Rome.	
	
  CAESAR. Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st	
	
  CAESAR. With most gladness;	
	
  CAITHNESS. Well, march we on	
	
  CAIUS. Ay, be gar, and 'tis a boy; be gar, I'll raise all	
	
  CAIUS. By gar, me vill kill de priest; for he speak for a jack-	
	
  CAIUS. Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.            Exit RUGBY	
	
  CAIUS. Me tank you for dat.	
	
  CAIUS. You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby.	
	
  CALIBAN. All the infections that the sun sucks up	
	
  CALIBAN. Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter,	
	
  CALIBAN. I say, by sorcery he got this isle;	
	
  CALIBAN. I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true	
	
  CALIBAN. The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean	
	
  CALPURNIA. Here, my lord.	
	
  CAMBRIDGE. So may your Highness, and yet punish too.	
	
  CAMPEIUS. Was he not held a learned man?	
	
  CANIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,	
	
  CANIDIUS. With news the time's with labour and throes forth	
	
  CAPHIS. Here, sir; what is your pleasure?	
	
  CAPTAIN. A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count	
	
  CAPTAIN. This is Illyria, lady.	
	
  CAPUCIUS. By heaven, I will,	
	
  CARDINAL. Bring me unto my trial when you will.	
	
  CARDINAL. Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:	
	
  CARDINAL. My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.	
	
  CARDINAL. This weighty business will not brook delay;	
	
  CASCA. A Roman.	
	
  CASCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler	
	
  CASCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was	
	
  CASCA. Speak, hands, for me!	
	
  CASCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man	
	
  CASSANDRA. No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother!	
	
  CASSIO.                       I am much bound to you.	
	
  CASSIO. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,	
	
  CASSIO. Dear general, I never gave you cause.	
	
  CASSIO. Ha, ha, ha!	
	
  CASSIO. I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily	
	
  CASSIO. I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.	
	
  CASSIO. Madam, I'll take my leave.	
	
  CASSIO. My hopes do shape him for the governor.	
	
  CASSIO. Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold	
	
  CASSIO. There is besides in Roderigo's letter,	
	
  CASSIO. What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!	
	
  CASSIUS. And died so?	
	
  CASSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,	
	
  CASSIUS. Chastisement?	
	
  CASSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!	
	
  CASSIUS. Good, I will expect you.	
	
  CASSIUS. I but believe it partly,	
	
  CASSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.	
	
  CASSIUS. Is't possible?	
	
  CASSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,	
	
  CASSIUS. So oft as that shall be,	
	
  CASSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.

  CHANCELLOR. This is too much;	
	
  CHARLES. For prisoners ask'st thou? Hell our prison is.	
	
  CHARLES. Good morrow to your worship.	
	
  CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,	
	
  CHARLES. Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms.

  CHILDREN. Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!	
	
  CHIRON. And that would she for twenty thousand more.

  CHORUS. Now entertain conjecture of a time	
	
  CICERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?	
	
  CINNA. Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.	
	
  CITIZEN. And you.	
	
  CITIZENS. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!	
	
  CLARENCE. Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things	
	
  CLARENCE. Clarence, Clarence, for Lancaster!	
	
  CLARENCE. For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves	
	
  CLARENCE. In God's name, what art thou?	
	
  CLARENCE. O, do not slander him, for he is kind.	
	
  CLARENCE. Tell him when that our princely father York

  CLEOPATRA. He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden	
	
  CLEOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some good news.	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Is not this buckled well?	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Is she as tall as me?	
	
  CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,	
	
  CLEOPATRA. No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.

  CLOTEN. All-worthy villain!	
	
  CLOTEN. Come, there's no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is	
	
  CLOTEN. I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason I was up	
	
  CLOTEN. No, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offence to	
	
  CLOTEN. Senseless? Not so.	
	
  CLOTEN. Thou injurious thief,	
	
  CLOTEN. Where is she, sir? Come nearer.	
	
  CLOTEN. Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.

  CLOWN. Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.	
	
  CLOWN. Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is more	
	
  CLOWN. Good Sir Toby!	
	
  CLOWN. I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose is no	
	
  CLOWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions

  CONSTANCE. That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,	
	
  CORIN. Else are they very wretched.	
	
  CORIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd	
	
  CORIN. That is the way to make her scorn you still.	
	
  CORIOLANUS. A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begg'd.	
	
  CORIOLANUS. Ay.	
	
  CORIOLANUS. First, hear me speak.	
	
  CORIOLANUS. How- traitor?	
	
  CORIOLANUS. I beseech you, peace!

  CRESSIDA. But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector	
	
  CRESSIDA. Diomed!	
	
  CRESSIDA. Have the gods envy?	
	
  CRESSIDA. How now! What's the matter? Who was here?	
	
  CRESSIDA. In that I'll war with you.	
	
  CRESSIDA. Nay, but you part in anger.	
	
  CRESSIDA. O Jupiter! there's no comparison.	
	
  CRESSIDA. O the gods! What's the matter?	
	
  CRESSIDA. So let it now; for it has been a great while going by.

  CYMBELINE. My daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength;	
	
  CYMBELINE. Nursing of my sons?	
	
  CYMBELINE. Son, let your mother end.

  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,	
	
  Cham. No, I'll none of it. I pray thee keep that for the hangman;	
	
  Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,

  Claud. Before God! and in my mind, very wise.	
	
  Claud. Give me your hand before this holy friar.	
	
  Claud. Hearken after their offence, my lord.	
	
  Claud. I wish him joy of her.	
	
  Claud. In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for the	
	
  Claud. Most sincerely.	
	
  Claud. No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him, and the	
	
  Claud. Now, signior, what news?	
	
  Claud. Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:	
	
  Claud. To what end? He would make but a sport of it and torment the	
	
  Claud. What, courage, man! What though care kill'd a cat, thou hast

  Corn. I'll answer that.	
	
  Corn. See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.	
	
  Corn. What trumpet's that?	
	
  Corn. Why art thou angry?	
	
  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?	
	
  Cur. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean the	
	
  DAUPHIN. Be warn'd by me, then: they that ride so, and ride not	
	
  DAUPHIN. My Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable, you talk of

  DEMETRIUS. I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point.	
	
  DEMETRIUS. Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory	
	
  DEMETRIUS. No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.	
	
  DEMETRIUS. She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;	
	
  DEMETRIUS. Villain, what hast thou done?	
	
  DEMETRIUS. Why, all these should be in the lantern; for all these

  DESDEMONA. Faith, half asleep.	
	
  DESDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.	
	
  DESDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.	
	
  DESDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.	
	
  DESDEMONA. It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,	
	
  DESDEMONA. O, but I fear- How lost you company?	
	
  DESDEMONA. Shall't be tonight at supper?	
	
  DESDEMONA. To do what?

  DIOMEDES. Thou dost miscall retire.	
	
  DIOMEDES. [Aside] And how his silence drinks up this applause!

  DUCHESS. I will be mild and gentle in my words.	
	
  DUCHESS. Not half so bad as thine to England's king,	
	
  DUCHESS. That's bad enough, for I am but reproach-	
	
  DUCHESS. Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this gear, the

  FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?	
	
  FREDERICK. No more, no more.	
	
  FRENCH KING. For us, we will consider of this further;	
	
  FRENCH KING. Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Montjoy,

  Fal. Both which I have had; but their date is out, and therefore	
	
  Fal. Depose me? If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically,	
	
  Fal. Faith, for their poverty, I know, not where they had that; and	
	
  Fal. How? the Prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup. 'Sblood, an he were

  Fal. Owen, Owen- the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer, and old

  Fal. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him	
	
  Fal. Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to

  Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast,	
	
  Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,	
	
  Fool. And I'll go to bed at noon.	
	
  Fool. For you know, nuncle,	
	
  Fool. Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and a

  Fool. Which they will make an obedient father.	
	
  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,	
	
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,	
	
  For it depends upon that love of thine.	
	
  For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.	
	
  For still temptation follows where thou art.	
	
  For then despite of space I would be brought,	
	
  For through the painter must you see his skill,	
	
  For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart	
	
  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,	
	
  Fran. Anon, sir.	
	
  Fran. My lord?	
	
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.	
	
  Friar. 'Tis well consented. Presently away;	
	
  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;

  GARDENER. Pardon me, madam; little joy have	
	
  GARDINER. I have done.	
	
  GARDINER. Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?	
	
  GARDINER. Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,

  GAUNT. O, but they say the tongues of dying men	
	
  GAUNT. Will the King come, that I may breathe my last	
	
  GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;	
	
  GENTLEWOMAN. Good night, good doctor.	
	
  GENTLEWOMAN. Pray God it be, sir.

  GEORGE. Yet let us all together to our troops,	
	
  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  When I was mortal, my anointed	
	
  GLOUCESTER. A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. And for the proffer of my lord your master,	
	
  GLOUCESTER. At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. But shall I live in hope?	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. For God's sake, take away this captive scold.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad	
	
  GLOUCESTER. I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?	
	
  GLOUCESTER. I would they were, that I might die at once;	
	
  GLOUCESTER. It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Madam, I am Protector of the realm;	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?	
	
  GLOUCESTER. My lord, will't please you pass along?	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Never came poison from so sweet a place.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Sirrah, or you must fight or else be hang'd.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Than my Lord Hastings no man might be	
	
  GLOUCESTER. The widow likes him not; she knits her brows.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;	
	
  GLOUCESTER. To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. We shall, my liege.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Well thought upon; I have it here about me.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Winchester goose! I cry 'A rope, a rope!'	
	
  GLOUCESTER. Your ships already are in readiness.	
	
  GLOUCESTER. [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,

  GRATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe,	
	
  GRATIANO. Yes, faith, my lord.	
	
  GREEN. Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts!	
	
  GREMIO. As willingly as e'er I came from school.	
	
  GREMIO. Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!	
	
  GREMIO. I am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in	
	
  GREMIO. Stay, Officer; he shall not go to prison.	
	
  GREMIO. What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!	
	
  GREY. And I, my royal sovereign.	
	
  GREY. The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son	
	
  GRIFFITH. Well, the voice goes, madam;	
	
  GROOM. Hail, royal Prince!	
	
  GRUMIO. Face not me. Thou hast brav'd many men; brave not me. I	
	
  GRUMIO. Help, masters, help! My master is mad.	
	
  GRUMIO. Katherine the curst!	
	
  GRUMIO. Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,	
	
  GRUMIO. The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.	
	
  GRUMIO. You are i' th' right, sir; 'tis for my mistress.	
	
  GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS. Stand, stand, and fight!	
	
  GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the heat o' th' sun	
	
  GUIDERIUS. I love thee; I have spoke it.	
	
  GUIDERIUS. No, nor thy tailor, rascal,	
	
  GUIDERIUS. To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I	
	
  GUIDERIUS. Why, he but sleeps.

  Ghost. My hour is almost come,	
	
  Glend. A shorter time shall send me to you, lords;	
	
  Glend. Cousin, of many men	
	
  Glend. She is desperate here. A peevish self-will'd harlotry,	
	
  Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!	
	
  Glou. Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone.	
	
  Glou. Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the Dukes,	
	
  Glou. Hath he never before sounded you in this business?	
	
  Glou. How fell you out? Say that.	
	
  Glou. Is it a beggarman?	
	
  Glou. Let go my hand.	
	
  Glou. O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!	
	
  Glou. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred	
	
  Glou. The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,	
	
  Glou. To Dover.	
	
  Glou. Where is the villain, Edmund?	
	
  Gon. At your choice, sir.	
	
  Gon. Holla, holla!	
	
  Gon. No more! The text is foolish.	
	
  Gon. So am I purpos'd.	
	
  Gon. This is mere practice, Gloucester.	
	
  Gon. [to Edmund] Then shall you go no further.	
	
  Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,	
	
  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.	
	
  Gregory, servant to Capulet.

  HASTINGS. And so swear I.                       [They embrace]	
	
  HASTINGS. Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;	
	
  HASTINGS. Hath the Prince John a full commission,	
	
  HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours,	
	
  HASTINGS. O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,	
	
  HASTINGS. Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd.	
	
  HASTINGS. With him, we may.	
	
  HECTOR. Fie, savage, fie!	
	
  HECTOR. How now! how now!	
	
  HECTOR. I pray you let us see you in the field;	
	
  HECTOR. Nay, I have done already.	
	
  HECTOR. Peace, sister, peace.	
	
  HECTOR. Why, then will I no more.	
	
  HELEN. Dear lord, you are full of fair words.	
	
  HELEN. Nay, this shall not hedge us out. We'll hear you sing,	
	
  HELENA. 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'	
	
  HELENA. And you, monarch!	
	
  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up!	
	
  HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?	
	
  HELENA. I do beseech you, sir,	
	
  HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very	
	
  HELENA. Lo, she is one of this confederacy!	
	
  HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.	
	
  HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,	
	
  HELENA. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.	
	
  HELENA. Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.	
	
  HELENA. That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you!	
	
  HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try,	
	
  HELENA. Why then to-night	
	
  HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight.	
	
  HENRY, surnamed BOLINGBROKE, Duke of Hereford, son of

  HERMIA. You speak not as you think; it cannot be.	
	
  HIPPOLYTA. Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;

  HOLOFERNES. Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in	
	
  HOLOFERNES. What mean you, sir?	
	
  HORTENSIO will be quit with thee by changing.             Exit	
	
  HORTENSIO. Alla nostra casa ben venuto,	
	
  HORTENSIO. Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten	
	
  HORTENSIO. Madam, 'tis now in tune.	
	
  HORTENSIO. Now go thy ways; thou hast tam'd a curst shrow.	
	
  HORTENSIO. Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?	
	
  HORTENSIO. Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;	
	
  HORTENSIUS. And mine, my lord.	
	
  HORTENSIUS. It is against my heart.	
	
  HOST. Ha! a fat woman? The knight may be robb'd. I'll call.	
	
  HOST. How now, bully rook! Thou'rt a gentleman.  [To

  HUBERT. O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,	
	
  HUME. Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage.	
	
  HUNTSMAN. This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.	
	
  Ham.   A whole one I!	
	
  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-	
	
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,	
	
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.	
	
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man	
	
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.

  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.	
	
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.	
	
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.	
	
  Ham. I embrace it freely,	
	
  Ham. I will watch to-night.	
	
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:	
	
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.	
	
  Ham. It waves me still.	
	
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool	
	
  Ham. My fate cries out	
	
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.

  Hast thou delight to see a wretched man	
	
  Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took	
	
  Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,	
	
  He did arrest me with an officer.	
	
  He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,	
	
  Heard you confess you had the chain of him,	
	
  Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.	
	
  Hero. And when I liv'd I was your other wife;       [Unmasks.]	
	
  Hero. Indeed he hath an excellent good name.	
	
  Hero. Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,	
	
  Hero. Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing	
	
  Hero. Why then, your visor should be thatch'd.	
	
  Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought	
	
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.	
	
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe	
	
  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.	
	
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;	
	
  Hor. Is't possible?	
	
  Hor. Most constantly.	
	
  Hor. No, by no means!	
	
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.	
	
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.	
	
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.	
	
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.

  How careful was I when I took my way,	
	
  How like a winter hath my absence been	
	
  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,	
	
  I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.	
	
  I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument	
	
  I hope I shall have leisure to make good;	
	
  I love not less, though less the show appear,	
	
  I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!	
	
  I see we still did meet each other's man,	
	
  I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.	
	
  I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,	
	
  I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

  IAGO.                 Well, my good lord, I'll do't.	
	
  IAGO.        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!	
	
  IAGO. And did you see the handkerchief?	
	
  IAGO. Are your doors lock'd?	
	
  IAGO. Be wise, and get you home.	
	
  IAGO. Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,	
	
  IAGO. Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carack;	
	
  IAGO. Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?	
	
  IAGO. Honest, my lord?	
	
  IAGO. I do not like the office;	
	
  IAGO. I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in	
	
  IAGO. Indeed!	
	
  IAGO. Is't possible, my lord?	
	
  IAGO. Marry, to- Come, captain, will you go?	
	
  IAGO. Nothing, my lord; or if- I know not what.	
	
  IAGO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the	
	
  IAGO. She's the worse for all this.	
	
  IAGO. Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico	
	
  IAGO. To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.	
	
  IAGO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak	
	
  IAGO. Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.	
	
  IAGO. Why, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service,

  IMOGEN. A father cruel and a step-dame false;	
	
  IMOGEN. Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains	
	
  IMOGEN. I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak;	
	
  IMOGEN. I see before me, man. Nor here, nor here,	
	
  IMOGEN. Most like I did, for I was dead.	
	
  IMOGEN. O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant	
	
  IMOGEN. Peace, my lord. Hear, hear!	
	
  IMOGEN. Senseless linen, happier therein than I!	
	
  IMOGEN. Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.

  ISABELLA. One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.	
	
  ISABELLA. Sir, make me not your story.

  If you did wed my sister for her wealth,	
	
  In gentle numbers time so idly spent,	
	
  In him those holy antique hours are seen,	
	
  In process of the seasons have I seen,	
	
  In the distraction of this madding fever!	
	
  In whose confine immured is the store,	
	
  Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee	
	
  It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

  KING RICHARD. Thanks, noble peer!	
	
  KING RICHARD. Then I must not say no.         Flourish. Exeunt	
	
  KING RICHARD. Then, by my self-	
	
  KING RICHARD. We thank you both; yet one but flatters us,

  MARCIUS. I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee	
	
  MARCIUS. They have a leader,	
	
  MARCUS. Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless	
	
  MARCUS. Brother, for in that name doth nature plead-	
	
  MARCUS. Fie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay	
	
  MARCUS. Now farewell, flatt'ry; die, Andronicus.	
	
  MARCUS. O brother, speak with possibility,	
	
  MARCUS. Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.	
	
  MARCUS. Who is this?- my niece, that flies away so fast?	
	
  MARCUS. You sad-fac'd men, people and sons of Rome,	
	
  MARGARELON. The devil take thee, coward!                       Exit	
	
  MARGARET. He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.	
	
  MARGARET. Say, Earl of Suffolk, if thy name be so,	
	
  MARGERY JOURDAIN, a witch	
	
  MARIA. Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits	
	
  MARIA. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note	
	
  MARIA. Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires	
	
  MARIA. My name is Mary, sir.	
	
  MARIA. Say you so? Fair lord-	
	
  MARIA. This, and these pearl, to me sent Longaville;	
	
  MARIA. Wide o' the bow-hand! I' faith, your hand is out.	
	
  MARIANA. Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the	
	
  MARIANA. I would Friar Peter-	
	
  MARIANA. Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face	
	
  MARSHAL. Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,	
	
  MARSHAL. Sound trumpets; and set forward, combatants.	
	
  MARTIUS. Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.	
	
  MARULLUS. May we do so?	
	
  MASTER-GUNNER. But now thou shalt not. Be thou rul'd	
	
  MAYOR. God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.	
	
  MAYOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.	
	
  MENAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a	
	
  MENAS. No slander: they steal hearts.	
	
  MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.	
	
  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.	
	
  MENELAUS. An odd man, lady? Every man is odd.	
	
  MENENIUS. A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep	
	
  MENENIUS. All's well, and might have been much better	
	
  MENENIUS. Consider this: he has been bred i' th' wars	
	
  MENENIUS. For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest,	
	
  MENENIUS. He loves your people;	
	
  MENENIUS. His nature is too noble for the world:	
	
  MENENIUS. I will make my very house reel to-night. A letter for me?	
	
  MENENIUS. Is this the promise that you made your mother?	
	
  MENENIUS. No, I'll not go. You hear what he hath said	
	
  MENENIUS. O, he's a limb that has but a disease-	
	
  MENENIUS. Pray now, your news?	
	
  MENENIUS. Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me	
	
  MENENIUS. The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.	
	
  MENENIUS. There was a time when all the body's members	
	
  MENENIUS. Well, no more.	
	
  MENENIUS. Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of	
	
  MENENIUS. You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes	
	
  MENTEITH. Who then shall blame	
	
  MESSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius	
	
  MESSALA. That, methinks, is strange.	
	
  MESSENGER. Ambassadors from Harry King of England	
	
  MESSENGER. Ay, dread Queen.	
	
  MESSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.	
	
  MESSENGER. Good madam, patience.	
	
  MESSENGER. It is spoke freely out of many mouths-	
	
  MESSENGER. Madam, madam-	
	
  MESSENGER. My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,	
	
  MESSENGER. No treachery, but want of men and money.	
	
  MESSENGER. So it appears by that I have to say.	
	
  MESSENGER. Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves	
	
  MESSENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.	
	
  MESSENGER. These were her words, utt'red with mild disdain:	
	
  MESSENGER. You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought	
	
  METELLUS. Is there no voice more worthy than my own,	
	
  MIRANDA. Alack, for mercy!	
	
  MIRANDA. I am a fool	
	
  MIRANDA. If by your art, my dearest father, you have

  MIRANDA. The strangeness of your story put

  MONTAGUE. But I have reasons strong and forcible.	
	
  MONTANO. 'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.	
	
  MONTANO. If partially affined, or leagued in office,	
	
  MONTGOMERY. And whoso'er gainsays King Edward's right,	
	
  MOON. All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is	
	
  MORTIMER. True; and thou seest that I no issue have,	
	
  MOTH.      If she be made of white and red,	
	
  MOTH. All hail, the richest heauties on the earth!	
	
  MOTH. And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.	
	
  MOTH. Forbear till this company be past.	
	
  MOTH. Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.	
	
  MOTH. Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such	
	
  MOTH. Peace! the peal begins.	
	
  MOTH. Which the base vulgar do call three.	
	
  MOTH. [Aside] He speaks the mere contrary: crosses love not him.	
	
  MOULDY. And, good Master Corporal Captain, for my old dame's sake,	
	
  MOWBRAY. No, Bolingbroke; if ever I were traitor,	
	
  MOWBRAY. This had been cheerful after victory.	
	
  MOWBRAY. Yea, but our valuation shall be such	
	
  MRS. FORD. But is my husband coming?	
	
  MRS. FORD. Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders;	
	
  MRS. FORD. I think my husband hath some special suspicion	
	
  MRS. FORD. If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's	
	
  MRS. FORD. Nay, by th' mass, that he did not; he beat him	
	
  MRS. FORD. There they always use to discharge their	
	
  MRS. FORD. Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you	
	
  MRS. FORD. Why?	
	
  MRS. OVERDONE. Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is	
	
  MRS. PAGE.  [Within]  What hoa, gossip Ford, what hoa!	
	
  MRS. PAGE. Are you not asham'd? I think you have kill'd the

  MUTIUS. My lord, you pass not here.	
	
  Making a famine where abundance lies,	
	
  Mar. 'Tis gone!	
	
  Mar. Lord Hamlet!	
	
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.	
	
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,	
	
  Marg. By my troth, 's not so good, and I warrant your cousin will	
	
  Marg. O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.	
	
  Marg. To have no man come over me? Why, shall I always keep below	
	
  May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.	
	
  Mer. And so did I.	
	
  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.	
	
  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.	
	
  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes- these	
	
  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy	
	
  Mer. Why, may one ask?	
	
  Mess. I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much	
	
  Mess. My lord, prepare. The King comes on apace.

  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:

  Mort. Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy	
	
  Mort. Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.	
	
  Mother. What noise is here?	
	
  Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?	
	
  My heavy eyelids to the weary night?	
	
  My master preaches patience to him, and the while	
	
  My name be buried where my body is,	
	
  My spirit is thine the better part of me,	
	
  My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,

  NATHANIEL. Welcome home, Grumio!	
	
  NERISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,	
	
  NERISSA. My lord and lady, it is now our time	
	
  NERISSA. They would be better, if well followed.	
	
  NERISSA. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.	
	
  NESTOR. Ay, my good son.	
	
  NESTOR. No Achilles with him.	
	
  NESTOR. What says Ulysses?	
	
  NICANOR, a Roman	
	
  NORFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion	
	
  NORFOLK. Believe it, this is true:	
	
  NORFOLK. How holily he works in all his business!	
	
  NORFOLK. My lord, we have	
	
  NORFOLK. Surely, sir,	
	
  NORFOLK. What, are you chaf'd?	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. For this I shall have time enough to mourn.	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. How is this deriv'd?	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, dispatch; read o'er these	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, nothing; all is said.	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. That were some love, but little policy.	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,	
	
  NORTHUMBERLAND. Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers	
	
  NURSE. Cornelia the midwife and myself;	
	
  NYM.  [To PAGE]  And this is true; I like not the humour of	
	
  NYM. My humour shall not cool; I will incense Page to deal	
	
  NYM. That now I will have; that's the humour of it.	
	
  NYM. [Sheathing his sword] I shall have my noble?	
	
  Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.	
	
  No longer mourn for me when I am dead,	
	
  No shape so true, no truth of such account,	
	
  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,	
	
  Nor now I had not, but that I am bound	
	
  Nor to her bed no homage do I owe;	
	
  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,	
	
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;	
	
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,	
	
  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.	
	
  Nurse. Even so lies she,	
	
  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!	
	
  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.	
	
  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.	
	
  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.	
	
  Nurse. O lamentable day!	
	
  Nurse. There's no trust,	
	
  Nurse. What's this? what's this?	
	
  O call not me to justify the wrong,	
	
  O if (I say) you look upon this verse,	
	
  O let my looks be then the eloquence,	
	
  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,	
	
  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:	
	
  OBERON. Do you amend it, then; it lies in you.	
	
  OBERON. Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.	
	
  OCTAVIA. Ay me most wretched,	
	
  OCTAVIA. Is it so, sir?	
	
  OCTAVIA. Thanks to my lord.	
	
  OCTAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.	
	
  OLD ATHENIAN. If in her marriage my consent be missing,

  OLD LADY. Beshrew me, I would,	
	
  OLIVER. And well he might so do,	
	
  OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.	
	
  OLIVER. Know you where you are, sir?	
	
  OLIVER. What mar you then, sir?	
	
  OLIVIA, a rich countess	
	
  OLIVIA. A sister! You are she.	
	
  OLIVIA. Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman.	
	
  OLIVIA. Go call him hither.                         Exit MARIA	
	
  OLIVIA. Here, wear this jewel for me; 'tis my picture.	
	
  OLIVIA. I have sent after him; he says he'll come.	
	
  OLIVIA. It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I	
	
  OLIVIA. O, say so, and so be!                           Exeunt	
	
  OLIVIA. Stay.	
	
  OLIVIA. What manner of man?	
	
  OLIVIA. Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.	
	
  OLIVIA. Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him.	
	
  ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.	
	
  ORLANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid	
	
  ORLANDO. For ever and a day.	
	
  ORLANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,	
	
  ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:	
	
  ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth.	
	
  ORLANDO. Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should	
	
  ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.	
	
  ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;	
	
  ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was	
	
  ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.	
	
  ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.	
	
  ORLEANS. Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Russian	
	
  ORLEANS. It is now two o'clock; but let me see- by ten	
	
  ORLEANS. The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lords!	
	
  OTHELLO.                               I say, amen.	
	
  OTHELLO.                           Yes, presently:	
	
  OTHELLO.                        It is too late.     He stifles her.	
	
  OTHELLO.                      O devil, devil!	
	
  OTHELLO.                     O the pernicious caitiff!	
	
  OTHELLO.                   I am not valiant neither,	
	
  OTHELLO.              So please your Grace, my ancient;	
	
  OTHELLO.             What dost thou say, Iago?	
	
  OTHELLO. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.	
	
  OTHELLO. Away!                                                Exit.	
	
  OTHELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.	
	
  OTHELLO. Devil!                                        Strikes her.	
	
  OTHELLO. Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate	
	
  OTHELLO. Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?	
	
  OTHELLO. I am not sorry neither. I'ld have thee live,	
	
  OTHELLO. I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee. No way but this,	
	
  OTHELLO. If thou dost slander her and torture me,	
	
  OTHELLO. It is the very error of the moon;	
	
  OTHELLO. Nay, if you strive-	
	
  OTHELLO. O Desdemona! Away! away! away!	
	
  OTHELLO. O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a	
	
  OTHELLO. Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face?	
	
  OTHELLO. The handkerchief!	
	
  OTHELLO. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;	
	
  OTHELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,	
	
  OTHELLO. What, not a whore?	
	
  OTHELLO. What, now?	
	
  OTHELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?	
	
  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,	
	
  Or bends with the remover to remove.	
	
  Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,	
	
  Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?	
	
  Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;	
	
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.	
	
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-	
	
  Osw. Ay, madam.	
	
  Osw. Help, ho! murther! murther!	
	
  Osw. Madam, with much ado.	
	
  Osw. Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.	
	
  Other. But is this law?	
	
  Others, but stewards of their excellence:

  PAINTER. I saw them speak together.	
	
  PAINTER. Nothing else. You shall see him a palm in Athens again,	
	
  PANDARUS. Ah, ah!	
	
  PANDARUS. Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?	
	
  PANDARUS. Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word	
	
  PANDARUS. Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.	
	
  PANDARUS. Friend, we understand not one another: I am to courtly,	
	
  PANDARUS. Himself! no, he's not himself. Would 'a were himself!	
	
  PANDARUS. I will be with you, niece, by and by.	
	
  PANDARUS. Is this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts,	
	
  PANDARUS. Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall it not,	
	
  PANDARUS. O, here he comes. How now, how now!	
	
  PANDARUS. That's Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He's one of the

  PAROLLES. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter. I

  PLANTAGENET. And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,	
	
  PLANTAGENET. Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?	
	
  PLANTAGENET. Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;	
	
  PLEBEIANS. Down with him, down with him!	
	
  PLEBEIANS. No, no, no, no, no.	
	
  POET. How now, philosopher!	
	
  POET. Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill	
	
  POET. When we for recompense have prais'd the vile,	
	
  POINS. Deliver'd with good respect. And how doth the martlemas,	
	
  POINS. My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.	
	
  POINS. Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait upon him at	
	
  POMPEY. Come, fear not you: good counsellors lack no clients.	
	
  POMPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,	
	
  POMPEY. I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?	
	
  POMPEY. I shall do well.	
	
  POMPEY. Know, then,	
	
  POMPEY. No; but there's a woman with maid by him. You have not	
	
  POMPEY. Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your	
	
  POMPEY. Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.	
	
  POMPEY. Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as	
	
  POMPEY. You have made me offer	
	
  PORTER. Here's a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of Hell	
	
  PORTER. Madam, I will.	
	
  PORTER. You i' th' camlet, get up o' th' rail;	
	
  PORTIA. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.	
	
  PORTIA. Come hither, fellow;	
	
  PORTIA. He is well paid that is well satisfied,	
	
  PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I will	
	
  PORTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers;	
	
  PORTIA. Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed,	
	
  PORTIA. Let not that doctor e'er come near my house;	
	
  PORTIA. Prithee, listen well.	
	
  PORTIA. There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper	
	
  PORTIA. Therefore, lay bare your bosom.	
	
  PORTIA. To these injunctions every one doth swear	
	
  PORTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.	
	
  PORTIA.. Go in, Nerissa;	
	
  POSTHUMUS. A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve	
	
  POSTHUMUS. Hang there like fruit, my soul,	
	
  POSTHUMUS. If you can make't apparent	
	
  POSTHUMUS. May be she pluck'd it of

  POSTHUMUS. Which by their graces I will keep.	
	
  PRIAM, King of Troy	
	
  PRIAM. Ay, but thou shalt not go.	
	
  PRINCE HENRY. O that there were some virtue in my tears,	
	
  PRINCE JOHN. A famous rebel art thou, Colville.	
	
  PRINCE JOHN. I pawn'd thee none:	
	
  PRINCE JOHN. Send Colville, with his confederates,	
	
  PRINCE JOHN. Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy!	
	
  PRINCE OF WALES. And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.	
	
  PRINCE OF WALES. Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;	
	
  PRINCE. And yours, most noble Bardolph!	
	
  PRINCE. From a god to a bull? A heavy descension! It was Jove's	
	
  PRINCE. How now! Rain within doors, and none abroad!	
	
  PRINCE. Is it upon record, or else reported	
	
  PRINCE. O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,	
	
  PRINCE. That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do you use	
	
  PRINCE. What pagan may that be?	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. A time, methinks, too short	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is dispos'd.	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Did he not send you twain?	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. How blow? how blow? Speak to be understood.	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Let it not be sweet.	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Our Lady help my lord! He'll be forsworn.	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Sweet health and fair desires consort your	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow:	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Will they return?	
	
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. You nickname virtue: vice you should have	
	
  PROSPERO, the right Duke of Milan	
	
  PROSPERO.  [Aside]  It goes on, I see,	
	
  PROSPERO. Ay, with a twink.	
	
  PROSPERO. But as 'tis,	
	
  PROSPERO. Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban	
	
  PROSPERO. For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,	
	
  PROSPERO. I am woe for't, sir.	
	
  PROSPERO. No harm.	
	
  PROSPERO. O, a cherubin	
	
  PROSPERO. Sweet now, silence;	
	
  PROSPERO. Thou dost; and think'st it much to tread the ooze	
	
  PROSPERO. What, I say,	
	
  PROVOST. Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.	
	
  PROVOST. Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,	
	
  PROVOST. Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.	
	
  PROVOST. I shall obey him.                      Exit MESSENGER	
	
  PROVOST. Pray you do. [Exit SERVANT] I'll know	
	
  PROVOST. This, my lord.	
	
  PROVOST. [Going] Save your honour!	
	
  PUBLIUS. Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns	
	
  PUCELLE. Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,	
	
  PUCELLE. Here's a silly-stately style indeed!	
	
  PUCELLE. Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man	
	
  PUCELLE. The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.	
	
  PUCK.         Captain of our fairy band,	
	
  PUCK. Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.	
	
  PUCK. I'll follow you; I'll lead you about a round,	
	
  PUCK. My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,	
	
  PYRAMUS. Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;	
	
  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.	
	
  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.	
	
  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.	
	
  Pedro. And when please you to say so?	
	
  Pedro. By my troth, I speak my thought.	
	
  Pedro. Do so. Farewell.	
	
  Pedro. Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter	
	
  Pedro. Hath any man seen him at the barber's?	
	
  Pedro. I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.	
	
  Pedro. Leonato and his brother. What think'st thou? Had we fought,	
	
  Pedro. Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.	
	
  Pedro. See, see! Here comes the man we went to seek.	
	
  Pedro. The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you. The gentleman that	
	
  Pedro. Well, as time shall try.	
	
  Pedro. What, a feast, a feast?	
	
  Pedro. You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your	
	
  Pedro. Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes	
	
  Pet. You will not then?	
	
  Peto. Nothing but papers, my lord.	
	
  Players.	
	
  Poins. Farewell, my lord.                                Exit.	
	
  Poins. Sir John, I prithee, leave the Prince and me alone. I will	
	
  Poins. Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been?	
	
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,	
	
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,	
	
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.	
	
  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.	
	
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I	
	
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,	
	
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.	
	
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,	
	
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together	
	
  Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday, she'll burn	
	
  Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;	
	
  Prince. Away, you rogue! Dost thou not hear them call?	
	
  Prince. Come hither, Francis.	
	
  Prince. Give it me. What, is it in the case?	
	
  Prince. He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a	
	
  Prince. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours	
	
  Prince. I do beseech your Majesty make up,	
	
  Prince. In both our armies there is many a soul	
	
  Prince. Nothing but a Colossus can do thee that friendship.	
	
  Prince. Now, Harry, whence come you?	
	
  Prince. Peace, chewet, peace!	
	
  Prince. Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the	
	
  Prince. Tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so	
	
  Prince. Thou judgest false already. I mean, thou shalt have the	
	
  Prince. Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of	
	
  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?	
	
  Prince. What, a hundred, man?	
	
  Prince. Where is it, Jack? Where is it?	
	
  Prince. Wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin, crystal-button,	
	
  Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,	
	
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a	
	
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay me, I see the ruin of my house!	
	
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, my boy; we will to	
	
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. It is determin'd, not concluded yet;	
	
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Kind sister, thanks; we'll enter	
	
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, no, my reasons are too deep and	
	
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou dost love my daughter from	
	
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To save her life I'll say she is not so.	
	
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan,	
	
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Windy attorneys to their client woes,	
	
  QUEEN KATHARINE. God mend all!	
	
  QUEEN KATHARINE. My lord, my lord,	
	
  QUEEN KATHARINE. Sir,	
	
  QUEEN KATHARINE. Your Graces find me here part of housewife;	
	
  QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.	
	
  QUEEN MARGARET. Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,	
	
  QUEEN MARGARET. I Call'd thee then vain flourish of my	
	
  QUEEN MARGARET. I told your Majesty as much before.	
	
  QUEEN MARGARET. O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy	
	
  QUEEN MARGARET. So now prosperity begins to mellow	
	
  QUEEN MARGARET. Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,	
	
  QUEEN MARGARET. Which God revenge!	
	
  QUEEN MARGARET. [Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.	
	
  QUEEN. And I could sing, would weeping do me good,	
	
  QUEEN. Banish us both, and send the King with me.	
	
  QUEEN. Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment'st thyself;	
	
  QUEEN. God forbid any malice should prevail	
	
  QUEEN. He is arrested, but will not obey;	
	
  QUEEN. Mischance and sorrow go along with you!	
	
  QUEEN. Now God in heaven forbid!	
	
  QUEEN. Pray walk awhile.	
	
  QUEEN. Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time	
	
  QUEEN. Why hopest thou so? 'Tis better hope he is;	
	
  QUICKLY. A softly-sprighted man, is he not?	
	
  QUICKLY. Ay me, he'll find the young man there, and be	
	
  QUICKLY. Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?	
	
  QUICKLY. I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic; hear the	
	
  QUICKLY. Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you	
	
  QUICKLY. That were a jest indeed! They have not so little	
	
  QUICKLY. Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn	
	
  QUINCE. 'Odious'- odorous!	
	
  QUINCE. At the Duke's oak we meet.	
	
  QUINCE. O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters! fly,	
	
  QUINCE. Why, what you will.	
	
  QUINCE. Yes, it doth shine that night.	
	
  QUINTUS. What, art thou fallen? What subtle hole is this,	
	
  Queen. Ay, amen!	
	
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.	
	
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,	
	
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.	
	
  Queen. O my son, what theme?	
	
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?	
	
  RAMBURES. He longs to eat the English.	
	
  RATCLIFF. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.	
	
  RATCLIFF. My lord?	
	
  REIGNIER. And so was mine, my lord.	
	
  REIGNIER. My lord, where are you? What devise you on?	
	
  REIGNIER. Upon thy princely warrant I descend	
	
  RICHARD. Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?	
	
  RICHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!	
	
  RICHARD. I cannot joy until I be resolv'd	
	
  RICHARD. Oft have I seen a hot o'er weening cur	
	
  RICHARD. Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did.	
	
  RICHMOND. Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,	
	
  RIVERS. And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty.	
	
  RIVERS. Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty	
	
  RIVERS. We wait upon your Grace.	
	
  ROBERT. My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,	
	
  RODERIGO.             Yes, sir, I have indeed.	
	
  RODERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?	
	
  RODERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.	
	
  RODERIGO. O wretched villain!	
	
  RODERIGO. Sir, I will answer anything. But, I beseech you,	
	
  RODERIGO. What say you?	
	
  ROMAN. I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I	
	
  ROSALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,	
	
  ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!	
	
  ROSALIND. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a	
	
  ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and	
	
  ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,	
	
  ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear	
	
  ROSALIND. God save you, brother.	
	
  ROSALIND. I have more cause.	
	
  ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,	
	
  ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.	
	
  ROSALIND. Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion	
	
  ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.	
	
  ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!	
	
  ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove!	
	
  ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,	
	
  ROSALIND. The little strength that I have, I would it were with	
	
  ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.	
	
  ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.	
	
  ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by	
	
  ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?	
	
  ROSALIND. Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?	
	
  ROSALINE. If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.	
	
  ROSALINE. Is the fool sick?	
	
  ROSALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it.	
	
  ROSALINE. The blood of youth burns not with such excess	
	
  ROSALINE. Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,	
	
  ROSALINE. You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.	
	
  ROSS. Alas, poor country,	
	
  ROSS. God save the King!	
	
  ROSS. No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.	
	
  ROSS. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.	
	
  ROSS. Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes	
	
  RUGBY. 'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.	
	
  RUTLAND. Ah, whither shall I fly to scape their hands?	
	
  Reg. And speak't again my lord. No more with me.	
	
  Reg. Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?	
	
  Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.	
	
  Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short	
	
  Reg. Out, treacherous villain!	
	
  Reg. That's as we list to grace him.	
	
  Reg. Wherefore to Dover, sir?	
	
  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,	
	
  Rey. Ay, my lord,	
	
  Richard Scroop, Archbishop of York.	
	
  Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,	
	
  Rom. A most courteous exposition.	
	
  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;	
	
  Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?	
	
  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.	
	
  Rom. Good heart, at what?	
	
  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.	
	
  Rom. I take thee at thy word.	
	
  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.	
	
  Rom. Nay, that's not so.	
	
  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.	
	
  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!	
	
  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?	
	
  Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.	
	
  Rom. Well, what was yours?	
	
  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.	
	
  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand	
	
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.	
	
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late	
	
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,	
	
  Ros. We shall, my lord.	
	
  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?	
	
  SALERIO. A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.	
	
  SALERIO. I did, my lord,	
	
  SALERIO. Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;	
	
  SALERIO. Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,	
	
  SALISBURY. Come, leave your drinking and fall to blows.	
	
  SALISBURY. It seems you know not, then, so much as we:	
	
  SALISBURY. Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.	
	
  SALISBURY. Peace, son! And show some reason, Buckingham,	
	
  SALISBURY. Then let's make haste away and look unto the main.

  SATURNINUS. Here, Tamora; though griev'd with killing grief.	
	
  SATURNINUS. No, Titus, no; the Emperor needs her not,	
	
  SATURNINUS. Thou shalt not bail them; see thou follow me.	
	
  SATURNINUS. What, madam! be dishonoured openly,

  SEBASTIAN. A match!	
	
  SEBASTIAN. Antonio, O my dear Antonio!	
	
  SEBASTIAN. By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me; the	
	
  SEBASTIAN. Foul weather?	
	
  SEBASTIAN. I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me;	
	
  SEBASTIAN. Madam, I will.	
	
  SEBASTIAN. O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.	
	
  SEBASTIAN. Save his Majesty!	
	
  SEBASTIAN. We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.	
	
  SEBASTIAN. Why	
	
  SECOND BANDIT. 'Tis his description.	
	
  SECOND CITIZEN. Consider you what services he has done for his

  SECOND CITIZEN. Whither are you going?	
	
  SECOND COMMONER. Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I

  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I shall.                                    Exit.	
	
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Is he found guilty?	
	
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That trick of state	
	
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. To what, I pray?	
	
  SECOND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.	
	
  SECOND KEEPER. Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.	
	
  SECOND LORD. Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence.	
	
  SECOND LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet	
	
  SECOND LORD. He sent to me, sir- here he comes.	
	
  SECOND LORD. His own impatience	
	
  SECOND LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?	
	
  SECOND LORD. My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame that,	
	
  SECOND LORD. My noble lord-	
	
  SECOND LORD. Peace, ho! No outrage- peace!	
	
  SECOND LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill	
	
  SECOND LORD. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave	
	
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of	
	
  SECOND MESSENGER. As certain as I know the sun is fire.	
	
  SECOND MESSENGER. Jack Cade hath gotten London Bridge.	
	
  SECOND MURDERER. Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to	
	
  SECOND MURDERER. Strike!	
	
  SECOND MURTHERER. I am one, my liege,	
	
  SECOND PETITIONER. Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk and	
	
  SECOND SENATOR. And shakes his threat'ning sword	
	
  SECOND SENATOR. Throw thy glove,	
	
  SECOND SENATOR. What thou wilt,	
	
  SECOND SERVANT. O, this is it that makes your servants droop!	
	
  SECOND SERVANT. Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?	
	
  SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.	
	
  SECOND VARRO'S SERVANT. My lord-	
	
  SECOND WATCH. Peace!	
	
  SECOND WATCH. What man is this?	
	
  SECOND WITCH. Show!	
	
  SEMPRONIUS. How! Have they denied him?

  SHALLOW. A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet, Sir	
	
  SHALLOW. By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this	
	
  SHALLOW. Come, Sir John, which four will you have?	
	
  SHALLOW. Ha, 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?	
	
  SHALLOW. Have with you, mine host.	
	
  SHALLOW. I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and	
	
  SHALLOW. It doth so.	
	
  SHALLOW. Let it be cast, and paid. Sir John, you shall not be	
	
  SHALLOW. Not a whit.	
	
  SHALLOW. Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star	
	
  SHALLOW. Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh	
	
  SHALLOW. Well, fare you well; we shall have the freer	
	
  SHALLOW. What think you, Sir John? A good-limb'd fellow; young,	
	
  SHERIFF. No, my good lord; therefore be patient.	
	
  SHYLOCK. 'Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,	
	
  SHYLOCK. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my	
	
  SHYLOCK. I have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose,

  SHYLOCK. Shall I not have barely my principal?	
	
  SHYLOCK. Shylock is my name.	
	
  SHYLOCK. What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?	
	
  SICILIUS. Great Nature like his ancestry	
	
  SICINIUS VELUTUS	
	
  SICINIUS. Answer to us.	
	
  SICINIUS. Draw near, ye people.	
	
  SICINIUS. He cannot temp'rately transport his honours	
	
  SICINIUS. I do demand,	
	
  SICINIUS. Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there;	
	
  SICINIUS. Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.	
	
  SICINIUS. Sir, how comes't that you	
	
  SICINIUS. Tell not me.	
	
  SICINIUS. This, as you say, suggested	
	
  SICINIUS. We know your drift. Speak what?	
	
  SICINIUS. Why, so he did, I am sure.	
	
  SILENCE.  [Singing]	
	
  SILENCE. By'r lady, I think 'a be, but goodman Puff of Barson.	
	
  SILIUS. Thou hast, Ventidius, that	
	
  SILVIUS. Call you this railing?	
	
  SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,	
	
  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.	
	
  SIMPCOX. But that in all my life, when I was a youth.	
	
  SIMPCOX. Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.	
	
  SIMPLE. I will, Sir.                                      Exit	
	
  SIMPLE., I thank your worship; I shall make my master glad

  SIR THOMAS GARGRAVE	
	
  SIR TOBY. And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?	
	
  SIR TOBY. Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after midnight is to	
	
  SIR TOBY. Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am. These	
	
  SIR TOBY. Do't, knight. I'll write thee a challenge; or I'll	
	
  SIR TOBY. Here comes the little villain.	
	
  SIR TOBY. I have been dear to him, lad- some two thousand strong,	
	
  SIR TOBY. My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's a	
	
  SIR TOBY. Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.	
	
  SIR TOBY. Peace, I say.	
	
  SIR TOBY. She'll none o' th' Count; she'll not match above her	
	
  SIR TOBY. To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall

  SIR TOBY. Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a

  SLENDER. Ay, by these gloves, did he-or I would I might	
	
  SLENDER. Ay, that I will come cut and longtail, under the	
	
  SLENDER. I love the sport well; but I shall as soon quarrel at	
	
  SLENDER. In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace, and	
	
  SLENDER. No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very	
	
  SLY. Am I a lord and have I such a lady?	
	
  SLY. I thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.	
	
  SLY. Y'are a baggage; the Slys are no rogues. Look in the	
	
  SMITH. [Aside] He need not fear the sword, for his coat is of	
	
  SNOUT. Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?	
	
  SOLANIO. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be	
	
  SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?	
	
  SOLDIER. My noble General, Timon is dead;	
	
  SOLDIER. O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;	
	
  SOME SPEAK. What does his lordship mean?	
	
  SOMERSET. But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.	
	
  SOMERSET. If York, with all his far-fet policy,	
	
  SOMERSET. My lord,	
	
  SOMERSET. The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;	
	
  SOMERSET. Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,	
	
  SON. I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?	
	
  SON. Who must hang them?	
	
  SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.	
	
  SOOTHSAYER. I make not, but foresee.	
	
  SOOTHSAYER. Your will?	
	
  STAFFORD. O gross and miserable ignorance!	
	
  STANLEY. Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.	
	
  STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from	
	
  STARVELING. I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is	
	
  STEPHANO,     "     "    "	
	
  STEPHANO. Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!	
	
  STEPHANO. He's in his fit now, and does not talk after the	
	
  STEPHANO. I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er	
	
  STEPHANO. Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll	
	
  STEPHANO. Stand farther. Come, proceed.	
	
  STEPHANO. Trinculo, run into no further danger; interrupt	
	
  STRATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:	
	
  SUFFOLK.  [Aside]  It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.	
	
  SUFFOLK. A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!	
	
  SUFFOLK. Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.	
	
  SUFFOLK. Before we make election, give me leave	
	
  SUFFOLK. For me, my lords,	
	
  SUFFOLK. How now, fellow! Wouldst anything with me?	
	
  SUFFOLK. I wish your Highness	
	
  SUFFOLK. Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness then	
	
  SUFFOLK. No malice, sir; no more than well becomes	
	
  SUFFOLK. Resign it then, and leave thine insolence.	
	
  SUFFOLK. The Cardinal's letters to the Pope miscarried,	
	
  SUFFOLK. Thou dar'st not, for thy own.	
	
  SUFFOLK. Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death?	
	
  SUFFOLK. Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord.	
	
  SURREY. I am joyful	
	
  SURREY. My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.	
	
  SURREY. Would he had!	
	
  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the	
	
  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.	
	
  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is	
	
  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate	
	
  Self, so self-loving were iniquity.	
	
  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can you	
	
  Sex. What else, fellow?	
	
  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'	
	
  She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i' th' wheel.	
	
  She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,	
	
  Show me your image in some antique book,	
	
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,	
	
  Sir Richard Vernon.	
	
  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,	
	
  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,	
	
  So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,	
	
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease	
	
  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.	
	
  Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,	
	
  Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,	
	
  Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,	
	
  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,	
	
  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.	
	
  TAILOR. This is true that I say; an I had thee in place where, thou	
	
  TALBOT. But ere we go, regard this dying prince,	
	
  TALBOT. He fables not; I hear the enemy.	
	
  TALBOT. I laugh to see your ladyship so fond	
	
  TALBOT. My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;	
	
  TALBOT. Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?	
	
  TALBOT. Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.	
	
  TALBOT. Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?	
	
  TAMORA. Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?	
	
  TAMORA. Now will I hence about thy business,	
	
  TAMORA. Stay, Roman brethen! Gracious conqueror,	
	
  TAMORA. What beg'st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go.	
	
  THE DUKE OF VENICE	
	
  THE SONG.	
	
  THERSITES. Do, do.	
	
  THERSITES. Finch egg!	
	
  THERSITES. Hum!	
	
  THERSITES. I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the	
	
  THERSITES. Nay, but regard him well.	
	
  THERSITES. Now the pledge; now, now, now!	
	
  THERSITES. There's Ulysses and old Nestor-whose wit was mouldy ere	
	
  THERSITES. Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.	
	
  THESEUS. A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.	
	
  THESEUS. I will hear that play;	
	
  THESEUS. It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is	
	
  THESEUS. Thanks, good Egeus; what's the news with thee?	
	
  THESEUS. This fellow doth not stand upon points.	
	
  THIRD BANDIT. Has almost charm'd me from my profession by	
	
  THIRD CITIZEN. But this is something odd.	
	
  THIRD CITIZEN. O royal Caesar!	
	
  THIRD CITIZEN. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!	
	
  THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Sir, his stoutness	
	
  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Thomas Cromwell,	
	
  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Yes, without all doubt.	
	
  THIRD LORD. I promise you, my lord, you mov'd me much.	
	
  THIRD MESSENGER. The news I have to tell your Majesty	
	
  THIRD ROMAN. A murrain on 't! I took this for silver.	
	
  THIRD SERVANT. O slaves, I can tell you news- news, you rascals!	
	
  THIRD SERVANT. What fellow's this?	
	
  THIRD SOLDIER. List, list!	
	
  THIRD WATCHMAN. But say, I pray, what nobleman is that	
	
  THISBY. And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.	
	
  THISBY. My love! thou art my love, I think.	
	
  THYREUS. He knows that you embrace not Antony	
	
  THYREUS. So, haply, are they friends to Antony.	
	
  TIMON. Ah, my good friend, what cheer?	
	
  TIMON. Away,	
	
  TIMON. Ay, that I am not thee.	
	
  TIMON. Commend me to them,	
	
  TIMON. Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip	
	
  TIMON. How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?	
	
  TIMON. I take all and your several visitations	
	
  TIMON. I, that I am one now.	
	
  TIMON. Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you;	
	
  TIMON. May you a better feast never behold,	
	
  TIMON. My worthy friends, will you draw near?	
	
  TIMON. O my friends,	
	
  TIMON. Slave!	
	
  TIMON. That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,	
	
  TIMON. They are fairly welcome.                   Exit SERVANT	
	
  TIMON. Under that's above me.	
	
  TIMON. Well; what further?	
	
  TIMON. Whither art going?	
	
  TIMON. Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men, and	
	
  TIMON. You do yourselves much wrong;	
	
  TIMON. [Aside] I'll meet you at the turn. What a god's gold,	
	
  TITANIA. I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.	
	
  TITANIA. These are the forgeries of jealousy;	
	
  TITANIA. What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;	
	
  TITINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.	
	
  TITUS. And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,	
	
  TITUS. Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me	
	
  TITUS. Do you hear, sir?	
	
  TITUS. Hear me, grave fathers; noble Tribunes, stay!	
	
  TITUS. I am not mad, I know thee well enough:	
	
  TITUS. It doth, my worthy lord, and in this match	
	
  TITUS. Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,	
	
  TITUS. One of Lord Timon's men.	
	
  TITUS. Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,	
	
  TITUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.	
	
  TITUS. Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to	
	
  TITUS. Who doth molest my contemplation?	
	
  TITUS. Why, there they are, both baked in this pie,	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were	
	
  TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be	
	
  TRANIO. 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,	
	
  TRANIO. And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?	
	
  TRANIO. Even he, Biondello.	
	
  TRANIO. Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.	
	
  TRANIO. Is 't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca	
	
  TRANIO. No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:	
	
  TRANIO. Saw you no more? Mark'd you not how her sister	
	
  TRANIO. That by degrees we mean to look into	
	
  TRANIO. Well, sir, to do you courtesy,	
	
  TREBONIUS. Caesar, I will. [Aside.] And so near will I be	
	
  TRIBUNE. We will discharge our duty.                    Exeunt	
	
  TRINCULO. I have been in such a pickle since I saw you	
	
  TRINCULO. I should know that voice; it should be-but he is	
	
  TRINCULO. That's more to me than my wetting; yet this is	
	
  TROILUS. A hateful truth.	
	
  TROILUS. And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.	
	
  TROILUS. Come, go we then together.                          Exeunt	
	
  TROILUS. Cressid comes forth to him.	
	
  TROILUS. For th' love of all the gods,	
	
  TROILUS. Have with you, Prince. My courteous lord, adieu.	
	
  TROILUS. I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels	
	
  TROILUS. No remedy.	
	
  TROILUS. O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus-	
	
  TROILUS. Say I she is not fair?	
	
  TROILUS. Sweet Pandarus!	
	
  TROILUS. Thou dost not speak so much.	
	
  TROILUS. When many times the captive Grecian falls,	
	
  TROILUS. Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart;	
	
  TUBAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter	
	
  TWO MURDERERS	
	
  TYRREL. I humbly take my leave.                           Exit	
	
  Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.	
	
  Tempteth my better angel from my side,	
	
  Than think that we before have heard them told:	
	
  Than when it hath my added praise beside.	
	
  That better is, by evil still made better.	
	
  That followed it as gentle day,	
	
  That god forbid, that made me first your slave,	
	
  That he is borne about invisible.	
	
  That in the very refuse of thy deeds,	
	
  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?	
	
  That she might think me some untutored youth,	
	
  That they behold and see not what they see?	
	
  That time of year thou mayst in me behold,	
	
  That would behold in me this shameful sport.	
	
  That's for thy self to breed another thee,	
	
  The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,	
	
  The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,	
	
  The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits	
	
  The fairest votary took up that fire,	
	
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,	
	
  The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,	
	
  The painful warrior famoused for fight,	
	
  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem	
	
  The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.	
	
  Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;	
	
  Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,	
	
  Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,	
	
  There had she not been long but she became	
	
  There left me and my man, both bound together;	
	
  Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command	
	
  They can be meek that have no other cause.	
	
  They were but sweet, but figures of delight:	
	
  This chain, which now you wear so openly.	
	
  This silence for my sin you did impute,	
	
  Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.	
	
  Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,	
	
  Thou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery.	
	
  Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,	
	
  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,	
	
  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!	
	
  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,	
	
  Thy self away, art present still with me,	
	
  Thyself I call it, being strange to me,	
	
  Tired with all these for restful death I cry,	
	
  To any sensual feast with thee alone:	
	
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,	
	
  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,	
	
  To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:	
	
  To make a rescue?	
	
  To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,	
	
  To put the finger in the eye and weep,	
	
  To side this title is impanelled	
	
  To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.	
	
  To-day did dine together. So befall my soul	
	
  Two Clowns, gravediggers.	
	
  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.	
	
  Tybalt, nephew to Lady Capulet.	
	
  ULYSSES. And wake him to the answer, think you?	
	
  ULYSSES. Here comes himself to guide you.	
	
  ULYSSES. It were no match, your nail against his horn.	
	
  ULYSSES. My lord!	
	
  ULYSSES. She will sing any man at first sight.	
	
  ULYSSES. There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles	
	
  ULYSSES. We saw him at the opening of his tent.	
	
  ULYSSES. [Aside] Wit would be out of fashion.	
	
  Unless a thousand marks be levied,	
	
  Unto a woman, happy but for me,	
	
  Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,	
	
  Urs. Madam, withdraw. The Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don	
	
  Use power with power, and slay me not by art,	
	
  VALENTINE. No, believe me.	
	
  VALERIA. O' my word, the father's son! I'll swear 'tis a very	
	
  VARRO'S SERVANT. How dost, fool?	
	
  VARRO'S SERVANT. Is't not your business too?	
	
  VAUX. Prepare there;	
	
  VERNON. Hark ye: not so. In witness, take ye that.	
	
  VERNON. Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you;	
	
  VINCENTIO. I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to	
	
  VINCENTIO. Thus strangers may be hal'd and abus'd. O monstrous	
	
  VIOLA. A blank, my lord. She never told her love,	
	
  VIOLA. And what should I do in Illyria?	
	
  VIOLA. Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arriv'd but	
	
  VIOLA. How can this be?	
	
  VIOLA. I thank thee. Lead me on.                        Exeunt	
	
  VIOLA. If I did love you in my master's flame,	
	
  VIOLA. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for	
	
  VIOLA. No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer.	
	
  VIOLA. No, my profound heart; and yet, by the very fangs of malice	
	
  VIOLA. Sure, my noble lord,	
	
  VIOLA. The rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my	
	
  VIOLA. Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?	
	
  VIOLENTA, neighbour and friend to the Widow	
	
  VIRGILIA. His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!	
	
  VIRGILIA. O, good madam, there can be none yet.	
	
  VOLSCE. It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you.	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Ay, and burn too.	
	
  VOLUMNIA. He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Indeed you shall not.	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Prithee now,	
	
  VOLUMNIA. Why, I pray you?	
	
  VOLUMNIUS. What says my lord?	
	
  Ver. To thirty thousand.	
	
  Verg. Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.	
	
  Verg. Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an	
	
  WART. Yea, sir.	
	
  WARWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget	
	
  WARWICK. Ay, but the case is alter'd.	
	
  WARWICK. Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the Duke	
	
  WARWICK. Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.	
	
  WARWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,	
	
  WARWICK. How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?	
	
  WARWICK. I came from Edward as ambassador,	
	
  WARWICK. Madam, be still- with reverence may I say;	
	
  WARWICK. Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,	
	
  WARWICK. No, 'tis impossible he should escape;	
	
  WARWICK. Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse	
	
  WARWICK. Sweet King! The Bishop hath a kindly gird.	
	
  WARWICK. Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves:	
	
  WARWICK. Then let the earth be drunken with our blood.	
	
  WARWICK. Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;	
	
  WARWICK. Warwick may live to be the best of all.	
	
  WARWICK. Who should that be? Belike unlook'd for friends.	
	
  WARWICK. Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous,	
	
  WESTMORELAND. Health to my sovereign, and new happiness	
	
  WESTMORELAND. I pledge your Grace; and if you knew what pains	
	
  WESTMORELAND. There is no need of any such redress;	
	
  WHITMORE. And so am I: my name is Walter Whitmore.	
	
  WHITMORE. Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?	
	
  WIDOW. Here you shall see a countryman of yours	
	
  WIDOW. Now I see	
	
  WIFE. Alas, sir, we did it for pure need!	
	
  WIFE. Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.	
	
  WILLIAM. Forsooth, I have forgot.	
	
  WILLIAM. Genitive: horum, harum, horum.	
	
  WILLIAMS. A good old commander and a most kind gentleman. I pray	
	
  WILLIAMS. Keep thy word. Fare thee well.	
	
  WILLIAMS. Sir, know you this glove?	
	
  WILLOUGHBY. The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man.	
	
  WINCHESTER. And am not I a prelate of the church?	
	
  WINCHESTER. I do, thou most usurping proditor,	
	
  WINCHESTER. Unreverent Gloucester!	
	
  WOLSEY. How much, methinks, I could despise this man,	
	
  WOLSEY. I am glad	
	
  WOLSEY. Madam, you wrong the King's love with these fears;	
	
  WOLSEY. Noble lady,	
	
  WOLSEY. Speak on, sir;	
	
  WOLSEY. The packet, Cromwell,	
	
  WOLSEY. Whilst our commission from Rome is read,	
	
  Was carried with more speed before the wind;	
	
  We came aboard.	
	
  We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.	
	
  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,	
	
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:	
	
  What is your substance, whereof are you made,	
	
  What thou dost foist upon us that is old,	
	
  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,	
	
  When I do count the clock that tells the time,	
	
  When day's oppression is not eased by night,	
	
  When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.	
	
  When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)	
	
  When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.	
	
  When what I seek (my weary travel's end)	
	
  Where have you left the money that I gave you?	
	
  Wherein I should your great deserts repay,	
	
  Which accidentally are met together.	
	
  Which have no correspondence with true sight,
